# ChroniclesDX
Changes made to Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood, with RomFS being injected programatically.

## To-do
- Redo music (possibly have streamed audio)
- Fix errors in script (e.g. Team Amy to Team Rose)
- Change script to remove cliffhanger ending (instead, connect to Unleashed)
- Make balances to gameplay (buff/nerf characters as needed)
- Change artstyle (CG but also possibly models)
