# ChroniclesDX
Changes made to Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood.

The list below is not the only things we're changing; we might change other things too. We just want to have a timeline of things.

## Script changes

- [X] Team Rose instead of Team Amy
- [X] References to other sonic media
  - [X] Sonic X, where Eggman had to cook for Bokune.
  - [X] Lost World, where Sonic and Eggman had to work together
  - [X] Mr Tinker (IDW), where Eggman changed his ways
  - [X] Shadow The Hedgehog, where Central City was hit by the Eclipse Cannon
  - [X] Sonic Boom, Season 2 Episode 4 - SonAmy is obligatory in the genre?
  - [X] Sonic Generations, Tails not seeing Green Hill.
  - [X] Sonic Forces - Sonic gets kidnapped
- [ ] Recharacterization of Shadow, to care slightly less about Omega.
  - His depiction should NOT match Boom or IDW aka WannaBe Vegetas.
  - Maybe have it match Archie??? I need archie fans to tell me if that's a good idea.
- [ ] Recharacterization of Omega to only hate Eggman Robots
  - Match the depiction in IDW Sonic #19, #20, #25, and the story arc of him getting his body rebuilt aka be kinder to other worthwhile Eggman robots
  - Him calling other humans meatbags is based on a Star Wars character, whomst BioWare happened to work on at the same time.
- [ ] Make the game heavily based on Unleashed, with naming and ending flowing straight into Unleashed.
  - Unleashed is the last game on the human world; Colors and Generations are independent and everything following takes place on Sonic's world.

## Music Changes

- [ ] Nocturne
- [ ] Central City

## To-do
- Redo music (possibly have streamed audio)
- Fix errors in script (e.g. Team Amy to Team Rose)
- Change script to remove cliffhanger ending (instead, connect to Unleashed)
- Make balances to gameplay (buff/nerf characters as needed)
- Change artstyle (CG but also possibly models)
