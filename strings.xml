  <string id="868">CAPTION: &quot;Suddenly, at the height of their arrogance, the Nocturnus Clan mysteriously vanished.&quot;</string>
  <string id="869">CAPTION: &quot;The dark sky opened and swallowed them whole. Gone were their cities, their people, their entire existence.&quot;</string>
  <string id="870">[Fade the captions out.]</string>
  <string id="871">[Fade in to a very wide shot of the countryside near Metropolis, at nighttime, looking somewhat peaceful--the calm before the storm. We slowly pan right, in a long enough pan to show a caption.]&#13;
</string>
  <string id="872">CAPTION: Some time ago....</string>
  <string id="873">[Keep panning as the caption fades. A second or two later, a fighter jet flies in front of the camera, holding long enough and close enough to show the letters &quot;GUN&quot; on its hull.]</string>
  <string id="874">[The plane then turns and swoops off. When the place flies away, we reveal a flaming Egg Carrier in the distance over the city. GUN airships and fighters are pelting the carrier with gunfire.]</string>
  <string id="875">CAPTION: Metropolis, headquarters of the evil Eggman</string>
  <string id="876">[Cut to inside the carrier. A big battle is going on between Eggman and Sonic-and-friends. Eggman has more or less lost already, but he won&apos;t go down without a fight.]</string>
  <string id="877">[As each character speaks, show a caption that tells us that character&apos;s name.]</string>
  <string id="878">This is it, Eggman! Give up!</string>
  <string id="879">Ha ha ha ha ha! You may have damaged my new Egg Carrier, Sonic, but you&apos;ll never defeat me!</string>
  <string id="880">We&apos;ll see about that! Tails! How&apos;s it coming?</string>
  <string id="881">Almost there, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="882">We have to hold him off! Tails needs more time!</string>
  <string id="883">We can do it!</string>
  <string id="884">Then let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="885">[Fighting ensues! If possible, show each character doing a signature move.]</string>
  <string id="886">Ha ha ha! Even together you can&apos;t beat me! This is my hour of victory!</string>
  <string id="887">Not after we bring this Egg Carrier down!</string>
  <string id="888">Tails! Now!</string>
  <string id="889">Right!</string>
  <string id="890">[Cut to outside the carrier. Explosions rock the big ship, and the ship begins to sink toward Metropolis. Cut back inside the carrier, to Eggman.]</string>
  <string id="891">What?! No!</string>
  <string id="892">[Explosions cover the screen. Back outside, explosions cover the ship as it falls. The GUN ships and fighters begin to leave the scene.]</string>
  <string id="893">[Back to Eggman.]</string>
  <string id="894">Curse you, Sonic! You haven&apos;t won yet!!</string>
  <string id="895">[Just then, a huge block of metal falls, cutting Sonic off from Eggman and apparently killing Eggman. Cut to a wide shot of the team.]</string>
  <string id="896">We have to get out of here!</string>
  <string id="897">What about Eggman?</string>
  <string id="898">There&apos;s no time! Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="899">[The team runs for safety, starting with Amy, then Knuckles. Tails lingers for a split second, then runs, and Sonic stands alone watching the direction Eggman went. Then he turns and dashes away at high speed.]</string>

  <string id="903">We did it!</string>
  <string id="904">You defeated Eggman, Sonic! There&apos;s no way he could escape that!</string>
  <string id="905">Yay!</string>
  <string id="906">[Knuckles gives a stoic and silent nod to Sonic.]</string>

  <string id="1019">This is as far as I can take you, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="1020">Good luck!</string>
  <string id="1021">[The captain goes back on the boat. The door closes, and the boat sails away.]</string>
  <string id="1026">I must... keep... working....</string>
  <string id="1027">Oh! Hey! You&apos;re Sonic the Hedgehog!</string>
  <string id="1028">I&apos;m so glad you showed up. I&apos;ve been chopping away at these logs for hours now, and I&apos;m not even close to done. </string>
  <string id="1030">But I&apos;m so tired, Sonic. I wish someone would help me. Even if just a little.</string>
  <string id="1031">Oh, it&apos;s easy! Just go over to the woodpile, and when the action bubble appears, touch it or press the L Button or R Button to chop the wood!</string>
  <string id="1032">The wood is just right there. Thank you so much!</string>
  <string id="1037">We have time to do this, Sonic. Let&apos;s help him!</string>
  <string id="1040">Oh, I won&apos;t burden you with that, Sonic. I&apos;m just an old man trying to chop some logs.</string>
  <string id="1042">You look like you could use some help.</string>
  <string id="1045">What do I need to do?</string>
  <string id="1050">I have important things to do!</string>
  <string id="1054">That&apos;s me!</string>
  <string id="1057">What are you working on out here?</string>
  <string id="1059">Oh, you did it! Thank you so much!</string>
  <string id="1060">I won&apos;t keep you any longer. Take this... I&apos;m too tired for even POW Candy to help me!</string>
  <string id="1061">Nice job, Sonic! You helped the man, and you got experience points!</string>
  <string id="1071">Oh, Sonic, thank you so much for helping a tired old man!</string>
  <string id="1556">As you know, we&apos;ve been tracking the Marauders for some time.</string>
  <string id="1557">For a while, we had no luck. But recently, our satellites noticed some activity at four locations in Green Hill Zone and Central City.</string>
  <string id="1558">Recognize those places?</string>
  <string id="1559">Those are Eggman&apos;s old hideouts.</string>
  <string id="1562">Unfortunately, we can&apos;t tell which, if any, of these hideouts is the one where they&apos;re keeping Knuckles.</string>
  <string id="1563">Sonic, you and your team will go to each of the hideouts and investigate. Rouge will go with you as your contact with GUN.</string>
  <string id="1564">Good. Our satellites have picked up activity at two locations in Green Hill Zone and two places inside Central City. </string>
  <string id="1566">We&apos;ll mark them on your map. Visit each one, and you should find the echidna.</string>
  <string id="1567">Good luck, team. Now go.</string>
  <string id="1568">We detected electronic resonance coming from those old hideouts, and we&apos;ve seen shadowy figures going in and out.</string>
  <string id="1569">But so far, no sign of Eggman himself. Just a few old, broken-down robots here and there.</string>
  <string id="1571">I can&apos;t spare troops, son. The Marauders are a major threat, and I can&apos;t leave the land unsecured.</string>
  <string id="1572">Besides, rescuing the echidna takes the kind of small-unit tactics you and your team are known for.</string>
  <string id="1573">I&apos;m better than any squad of boneheaded GUN troops, anyway. I promise, with Rouge around, you won&apos;t miss those soldiers a bit.</string>
  <string id="1581">Let&apos;s get moving. We have to save Knuckles.</string>
  <string id="1586">Have you seen any sign of Eggman?</string>
  <string id="1589">So, instead of GUN troops, you&apos;re giving us ROUGE?</string>
  <string id="1861">Amy</string>
  <string id="1865">And stay down.</string>
  <string id="1866">Knuckles! You&apos;re alive!</string>
  <string id="1867">I am. I thought you might try to rescue me. I just wasn&apos;t going to sit around and wait.</string>
  <string id="1868">I see you called in Sonic. If it were any other situation, I might say that wasn&apos;t necessary.</string>
  <string id="1870">It&apos;s the Marauders. They took the last Chaos Emerald, just as we predicted. </string>
  <string id="1871">They somehow disabled Tails&apos; trap and overwhelmed me with numbers. </string>
  <string id="1872">There must have been a lot of them!</string>
  <string id="1873">There were, and they fought like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen. Still, I would have beaten them, but their leader was too strong.</string>
  <string id="1874">I assume they got the Emerald?</string>
  <string id="1875">Yes. I&apos;m sorry, Knuckles, I couldn&apos;t take them by myself. </string>
  <string id="1876">Then I&apos;m going to get it back.</string>
  <string id="1877">This is my fight, Sonic. I am the last echidna and the guardian of the Emeralds.</string>
  <string id="1878">And I definitely don&apos;t want to team up with that bat!</string>
  <string id="1879">Mm. The feeling is mutual.</string>
  <string id="1880">Oh, don&apos;t be pig-headed, Knuckles! You can&apos;t do this on your own!</string>
  <string id="1881">Fine. You can come. But don&apos;t get in my way.</string>
  <string id="1883">You&apos;ve been gone a long time, Sonic, so I&apos;ll say this nicely.</string>
  <string id="1884">You&apos;re not the boss around here. Not anymore. YOU decided to go away for a while. Not me. </string>
  <string id="1885">Hm.</string>
  <string id="1886">So what do we do?</string>
  <string id="1887">We go to Angel Island and protect the Master Emerald. We need to get up there before the Marauders do.</string>
  <string id="1889">There&apos;s no time to stand around talking. Let&apos;s hurry.</string>
  <string id="1890">You have been gone a while, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="1891">Absence makes the heart grow fonder, right?</string>
  <string id="1892">But you came back when we needed you!</string>
  <string id="1894">I...</string>
  <string id="1895">I have a boyfriend....</string>
  <string id="1896">You... You&apos;re probably right. I couldn&apos;t beat them alone.</string>
  <string id="1897">Just know that they&apos;re very strong, and very dangerous. They have technology unlike anything I&apos;ve ever seen before.</string>
  <string id="1898">They seem to come out of nowhere. If defeated, they disappear into thin air.</string>
  <string id="1899">We&apos;ve never fought anything like this before, Sonic. </string>
  <string id="1901">Not much. They wore dark masks and armor, so I couldn&apos;t make out who they were. </string>
  <string id="1902">They wear high-tech armor and fight like mad. Whoever they are, they&apos;re trained for battle.</string>
  <string id="1903">But I&apos;m not sure they&apos;re working alone. Someone else was calling the shots, but I couldn&apos;t tell who.</string>
  <string id="1904">Anytime the Chaos Emeralds are in danger, Eggman&apos;s the first villain I think of.</string>
  <string id="1908">Sonic!</string>
  <string id="1909">Knuckles is the finest guardian of the Master Emerald ever! He&apos;s never failed to protect it before!</string>
  <string id="1917">What&apos;s going on here, Knuckles?</string>
  <string id="1925">We&apos;ll go with you.</string>
  <string id="1930">Your way? We came here to save YOU, remember?</string>
  <string id="1933">Well, I&apos;m back now. Let&apos;s get to work.</string>
  <string id="1939">Do the rest of you feel this way, too?</string>
  <string id="1942">What about you, Amy?</string>
  <string id="1946">You need us, Knuckles. We can help beat the Marauders.</string>
  <string id="1950">We can do this. I promise.</string>
  <string id="1952">Knuckles, what do you know about the Marauders?</string>
  <string id="1955">Let&apos;s go. We have to stop the Marauders!</string>
  <string id="1956">Could they be working for Eggman?</string>
  <string id="1960">Some guardian you turned out to be!</string>
  <string id="1963">We have to get moving. No doubt Shade knows you found me.</string>
  <string id="1964">Right. Let&apos;s get back to the workshop now!</string>
  <string id="1965">No. Wait. Look in the sky!</string>
  <string id="1966">What is it?</string>
  <string id="2045">Timmy! They found you!</string>
  <string id="2054">I&apos;m so worried. I hope Timmy is okay!</string>
  <string id="2066">Oh, Sonic the Hedgehog! I need your help! My son Timmy is stuck in a well!</string>
  <string id="2118">Thank you! You saved me!</string>
  <string id="2120">I don&apos;t know! I had just built a fort in here, and I was hooking up my new defense system when they came!</string>
  <string id="2121">Defense system?</string>
  <string id="2123">Oh, it&apos;s this piece of metal I found. It&apos;s just junk, but I pretended it was an alarm and a cannon! But I think the scorpion wanted to take it away!</string>
  <string id="2124">Why would a scorpion want that piece of junk?</string>
  <string id="2125">Can I see that?</string>
  <string id="2126">Sure, you can keep it! I never want to see it again!</string>
  <string id="2130">Thanks again, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="2132">Look, Sonic! It&apos;s another Eggman device. Hm. I think I have all I need to... Yes!</string>
  <string id="2133">These fit together like so... and you clip this here... and connect this... Yay!</string>
  <string id="2134">The devices come together to form some kind of random pattern generator. I&apos;m not sure what it&apos;s for.</string>
  <string id="2136">We&apos;d better keep looking for Eggman. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="2138">Look, Sonic! It&apos;s another Eggman device. Maybe that&apos;s what set off those animals!</string>
  <string id="2139">Look, Sonic. There&apos;s an Eggman device! Maybe that&apos;s what set off those animals!</string>
  <string id="2140">That must be what our tracker detected!</string>
  <string id="2141">Hm. I can&apos;t tell what it&apos;s used for. Maybe I can examine it some other time. </string>
  <string id="2142">I never thought I&apos;d be saved by the famous Sonic the Hedgehog!</string>
  <string id="2143">Help! Help!</string>
  <string id="2147">Why was that scorpion so mad at you?</string>
  <string id="2154">Can you find your way home?</string>
  <string id="2157">You&apos;ve heard of me?</string>
  <string id="2170">You&apos;re safe now. Can you find your way home?</string>
  <string id="2177">Ah, Sonic the Hedgehog! I heard you came back!</string>
  <string id="2178">What can I do ya for?</string>
  <string id="2179">Aww. No way. Eggman&apos;s here. </string>
  <string id="2181">Eggman? Are you folks looking for Eggman?</string>
  <string id="2182">Yes! Have you seen him?</string>
  <string id="2183">No sir, no I haven&apos;t. But I thought he was gone for good!</string>
  <string id="2184">So did we.</string>
  <string id="2185">Sorry to have bothered you, sir.</string>
  <string id="2186">Oh, it&apos;s no bother at all!</string>
  <string id="2187">You folks are welcome here any time!</string>
  <string id="2188">I don&apos;t know, young fella. I&apos;ve been called many things in my day, but as you can see, I&apos;m not Eggman!</string>
  <string id="2189">I do have a strange piece of equipment I picked up the other day. Maybe it&apos;s messing with your machine there.</string>
  <string id="2190">What sort of equipment?</string>
  <string id="2191">Oh, I got it this from a salesman a couple days ago. Said his name was Sal, I think. </string>
  <string id="2192">He told me it was a coffee maker, he did. And I love me some coffee!</string>
  <string id="2194">Anyway, after he left, I couldn&apos;t get it to work. </string>
  <string id="2202">Well, let&apos;s keep looking for Eggman.</string>
  <string id="2206">Why would our Eggman tracker lead us here?</string>
  <string id="2213">Are you sure that thing is working correctly?</string>
  <string id="2214">I traded him my favorite stapler for it, I tell you. I don&apos;t know what came over me.</string>
  <string id="2215">I think I was ripped off. I don&apos;t think it is a coffee maker at all!</string>
  <string id="2216">Maybe our tracker is picking up that machine.</string>
  <string id="2217">See it? I&apos;ll do ya one better. If you can get me my stapler back, you can have it.</string>
  <string id="2218">That salesman said he was heading off into Green Hill Zone. I got no idea what he&apos;d be doing out there. </string>
  <string id="2219">Get me my stapler, and this dratted machine is yours.</string>
  <string id="2221">I sure would be thankful, Sonic. Just come on back here when you&apos;re done. </string>
  <string id="2222">I&apos;ll have that piece of equipment all shined up by the time you get back!</string>
  <string id="2223">Name&apos;s Sal, I believe. He&apos;s a shifty sort, but my old coffee maker went on the fritz, and I was desperate!</string>
  <string id="2224">I don&apos;t know much more than that. Just look for someone who looks like a rotten cheat, and that&apos;ll be him. </string>
  <string id="2225">If it&apos;s a piece of Eggman equipment, it might be worth looking at. Maybe it can help us find him.</string>
  <string id="2226">I&apos;d be very grateful for your help, Sonic. But I understand if you can&apos;t do it.</string>
  <string id="2227">The poor man! We have to help him!</string>
  <string id="2228">This is a waste of time, but we can&apos;t let that salesman get away with this.</string>
  <string id="2229">I want to meet this salesman. Sounds like quite a charmer!</string>
  <string id="2230">This old man is so nice. Let&apos;s help him, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="2231">Uh.... What was the question?</string>
  <string id="2232">I understand. I&apos;m sure you folks have plenty to do.</string>
  <string id="2233">It&apos;s picking something up around here, that&apos;s for sure!</string>
  <string id="2234">If it isn&apos;t Sonic the Hedgehog and his little buddies!</string>
  <string id="2235">What can I do ya for?</string>
  <string id="2236">Well, all right. Good day to you!</string>
  <string id="2237">Fantabulous! Splendid!</string>
  <string id="2238">And as promised, here is that blasted machine.</string>
  <string id="2239">I hope you find some use for it. I certainly didn&apos;t!</string>
  <string id="2240">Look, Sonic! It&apos;s another Eggman device. Hm. I think I have all I need to... Yes!</string>
  <string id="2241">These fit together like so... and you clip this here... and connect this... Yay!</string>
  <string id="2242">The devices come together to form some kind of random pattern generator. I&apos;m not sure what it&apos;s for.</string>
  <string id="2244">We&apos;d better keep looking for Eggman. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="2246">Look, Sonic! It&apos;s another Eggman device. No wonder the old man couldn&apos;t get it to make coffee!</string>
  <string id="2247">Look, Sonic. It wasn&apos;t a coffee maker at all! It&apos;s an Eggman device!</string>
  <string id="2248">That must be what our tracker detected!</string>
  <string id="2249">Hm. I can&apos;t tell what it&apos;s used for. Maybe I can examine it some other time. </string>
  <string id="2253">Oh well. We should get back to finding Eggman.</string>
  <string id="2254">May we see that machine?</string>
  <string id="2257">Don&apos;t worry. We&apos;ll get your stapler back for you.</string>
  <string id="2261">What do you know about this salesman?</string>
  <string id="2263">Do you guys feel like doing this?</string>
  <string id="2270">Sorry, old man. We can&apos;t help you.</string>
  <string id="2274">Nothing, really. Just passing through.</string>
  <string id="2276">May we see your coffee machine?</string>
  <string id="2277">We got your stapler back for you.</string>
  <string id="2290">Good day, my friend! Might I interest you in a bargain?</string>
  <string id="2291">No, thanks. We&apos;re in a hurry.</string>
  <string id="2292">I know you cheated the shopkeeper.</string>
  <string id="2293">What are you selling?</string>
  <string id="2294">Well, I might have something to help with that. But hey, it&apos;s your loss!</string>
  <string id="2295">Be well, my friends!</string>
  <string id="2296">What? Me, cheat? You must be mistaken.</string>
  <string id="2297">The last time I traded anything to a shopkeeper, it was a fair deal: his stapler for my coffee maker.</string>
  <string id="2298">A deal is a deal, my friends. You look like smart folks; you know how the world works.</string>
  <string id="2299">Well, I.... You don&apos;t have to get upset, now!</string>
  <string id="2300">I&apos;ll be glad to give you the stapler! I--I didn&apos;t want it, anyway. Too... shiny.</string>
  <string id="2301">Here! May your papers stay together forever, I say. Whew.</string>
  <string id="2302">And on that note, I&apos;ll be on my way. People to see, and all that!</string>
  <string id="2303">Ta!</string>
  <string id="2304">Trading! Something for something, nothing for nothing!</string>
  <string id="2305">It&apos;s the greatest thing in the world, trading. None of this cash money baloney. And a deal is a deal!</string>
  <string id="2306">Wonderful. I hoped you&apos;d say that. </string>
  <string id="2307">Might I interest you in a nice little above-ground pool? It&apos;s economy-sized!</string>
  <string id="2309">A plastic cup? Or a POOL?</string>
  <string id="2310">You think about it, huh? I&apos;ll be around!</string>
  <string id="2311">Oh! Fabulous things. Things you can&apos;t live without!</string>
  <string id="2312">Of course, I don&apos;t sell things for money. I&apos;m a bartering man. Goods for goods! Easy trade!</string>
  <string id="2313">What do you need? New socks? A jaunty hat? A sack of tomatoes?</string>
  <string id="2314">Perhaps a cute little toy bunny for the young lady?</string>
  <string id="2315">Tee hee!</string>
  <string id="2317">I have lots of things, wonderful things! All yours for a reasonable price. </string>
  <string id="2321">Give me that stapler or else!</string>
  <string id="2327">And how does the world work?</string>
  <string id="2329">Fine, keep the stapler. I have other things to do.</string>
  <string id="2331">That&apos;s a plastic cup.</string>
  <string id="2340">Hello again! Back for another look at the finest items this side of the Blue Ridge Zone?</string>

  <string id="2363">*bzt* My duties complete, I can now rest. *bzt*</string>
  <string id="2364">*bzt* Thank you, soft creatures. *bzt* Now I have found rest. *bzt*</string>
  <string id="2365">Look, Sonic! The robot&apos;s head looks like another Eggman device. Hm. I think I have all I need to... Yes!</string>
  <string id="2366">These fit together like so... and you clip this here... and connect this... Yay!</string>
  <string id="2367">The devices come together to form some kind of random pattern generator. I&apos;m not sure what it&apos;s for.</string>
  <string id="2369">We&apos;d better keep looking for Eggman. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="2371">Look, Sonic! The robot&apos;s head is another Eggman device. It must be old if it&apos;s forgotten its programming!</string>
  <string id="2372">Look, Sonic. The robot&apos;s head... it&apos;s an Eggman device!</string>
  <string id="2373">That must be what our tracker detected!</string>
  <string id="2374">Hm. I can&apos;t tell what it&apos;s used for. Maybe I can examine it some other time. </string>
  <string id="2375">I say we smash it!</string>
  <string id="2376">I say we ignore it and keep moving.</string>
  <string id="2377">I don&apos;t know, Sonic. What if this is a clue?</string>
  <string id="2378">Oh, Sonic! We have to help it! It&apos;s so sad!</string>
  <string id="2379">Really? We&apos;re debating what to do about a sad robot that&apos;s not attacking us? </string>
  <string id="2380">And everyone thinks I&apos;M crazy.</string>
  <string id="2381">What&apos;s everyone staring at?</string>
  <string id="2382">*bzt* Please help. *bzt* My function is unknown to me. *bzt*</string>
  <string id="2384">I don&apos;t care about your function.</string>
  <string id="2398">We have more important things to do right now.</string>
  <string id="2401">You are an Eggman robot. You were made to serve Eggman.</string>
  <string id="2405">You have completed your duties. You are free. </string>
  <string id="2418">What do you guys think we should do?</string>
  <string id="2473">I don&apos;t have time for this.</string>
  <string id="2476">That&apos;s right, coward! Run!</string>
  <string id="2477">Hey, Shadow left something behind. This is what set off our tracker!</string>
  <string id="2478">It looks like another Eggman device. Hm. I think I have all I need to... Yes!</string>
  <string id="2479">These fit together like so... and you clip this here... and connect this... Yay!</string>
  <string id="2480">The devices come together to form some kind of random pattern generator. I&apos;m not sure what it&apos;s for.</string>
  <string id="2482">We&apos;d better keep looking for Eggman. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="2484">It looks like an Eggman device. I wonder what Shadow was doing with it.</string>
  <string id="2485">Hm. I think I have an idea what we can do with these devices. Let&apos;s look around for more.</string>
  <string id="2571">Stop, my robot sentries! Desist!</string>
  <string id="2572">Eggman!</string>
  <string id="2573">I knew he was still around! I knew it!</string>
  <string id="2574">You&apos;re finished, Eggman!</string>
  <string id="2575">Yes, yes, Sonic. I know. Please stand down and let us speak of this like civilized men!</string>
  <string id="2576">Don&apos;t trust him, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="2577">Ha ha ha! My dear, I wouldn&apos;t trust me, either!</string>
  <string id="2578">But I am as angry as you are that someone has the gall to activate MY old machines and use them for their own purposes!</string>
  <string id="2580">It just looks bad, I tell you. I was young when I made those old robots! Young and full of beans!</string>
  <string id="2581">Why should we trust you, Eggman?</string>
  <string id="2582">He&apos;s right, Eggman. Everything points to you.</string>
  <string id="2583">Ha ha ha! Sonic, it&apos;s adorable how much you hate me.</string>
  <string id="2584">But you simply must trust me, my blue spiky friend.</string>
  <string id="2585">For I, the illustrious Doctor Robotnik...</string>
  <string id="2586">... have utterly and completely reformed!</string>
  <string id="2862">That&apos;s quite far enough.</string>
  <string id="2863">That voice....</string>
  <string id="2864">Abandon your quest and back away now. This is the last warning before we exterminate you.</string>
  <string id="2865">You must be Shade.</string>
  <string id="2867">Yes. I am Shade of the exiled Nocturnus Clan. </string>
  <string id="2868">Turn around now, primitives. Don&apos;t make me destroy you.</string>
  <string id="2869">What have you done with the Chaos Emeralds?!</string>
  <string id="2870">Don&apos;t worry. They&apos;re safe.</string>
  <string id="2871">We are simply returning them to their true masters!</string>
  <string id="2873">What?!?</string>
  <string id="2874">But I thought Knuckles was the last!</string>
  <string id="2875">This is... not possible! Only my bloodline survived the wrath of Perfect Chaos!</string>
  <string id="2876">Your clan paid for its arrogance, but the Nocturnus Clan was wrongly punished for our success. And now we will return to this world!</string>
  <string id="2877">You can&apos;t be the Nocturnus Clan. This is a trick!</string>
  <string id="2878">And yet here I stand. Now, step aside, or I will show you the power of the Nocturnus!</string>
  <string id="2880">Let me see you try!</string>
  <string id="2881">Everyone! Fall back! Now!</string>
  <string id="2882">This party is over, friends. You will not follow us.</string>
  <string id="2885">No!!!</string>
  <string id="2887">Amy... Amy!</string>
  <string id="2888">We have to find another way.</string>
  <string id="2889">Oh, spare me the crying. This is my city. I know every possible way in. </string>
  <string id="2890">There are railway tunnels that lead into the city not far from here. If we can find one, and it&apos;s not completely caved in....</string>
  <string id="2891">We can get in that way.</string>
  <string id="2892">Sonic, I think it&apos;s our only hope.</string>
  <string id="2893">The tunnels are off to the west. </string>
  <string id="2894">The Marauders won&apos;t just let us go. We should be careful.</string>
  <string id="2895">Let&apos;s go, team!</string>
  <string id="2896">There are countless ways into my city! Er, most of which I have kept secret... even from myself!</string>
  <string id="2897">I designed the subway system myself. I have no doubt the tunnels withstood the destruction of Metropolis.</string>
  <string id="2898">Well, it should.</string>
  <string id="2899">Yes... I....</string>
  <string id="2900">We have work to do, Sonic. We&apos;ll talk about this later.</string>
  <string id="2926">It&apos;s okay, Amy. We&apos;ll get through, I promise.</string>
  <string id="2931">Then let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="2935">Eggman, are these tunnels the only way in?</string>
  <string id="2937">That doesn&apos;t fill me with confidence.</string>
  <string id="2938">Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="2939">Knuckles? Are you all right?</string>
  <string id="3247">Didn&apos;t your mommy ever tell you not to take things that don&apos;t belong to you?</string>
  <string id="3248">Master Ix, the hedgehog is here.</string>
  <string id="3249">Fools! Insignificant worms who beg for annihilation. </string>
  <string id="3250">Leave Shade to me, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="3251">So. You feel worthy of combat with my finest warrior, do you?</string>
  <string id="3252">Knuckles, was it? &quot;Last of the Echidnas&quot;? It must be shameful to have been misled all these years.</string>
  <string id="3253">Quit babbling and bring it on!</string>
  <string id="3254">Frankly, my hotheaded worm, you are not worthy. </string>
  <string id="3255">Come, my minions. Brush away these motes of dust as I make my victory complete!</string>
  <string id="3256">Power-mad techno-wizards and Nocturnus assassins. It&apos;s been good fighting with you, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="3257">Don&apos;t get all misty on me, Knuckles. It ain&apos;t over yet!</string>
  <string id="3467">Enough of this!</string>
  <string id="3468">You&apos;ve fought well, but even you cannot stop me from conquering this world!</string>
  <string id="3469">Imperator Ix... we never discussed conquering this world. We only wanted to return to it! I won&apos;t....</string>
  <string id="3476">I have what I came for, little worms. Now that I have the Master Emerald, no one can stop me!</string>
  <string id="3477">Look well upon your world. Soon it will all be mine!</string>
  <string id="3479">No!</string>
  <string id="3481">Ha ha ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="3483">No!</string>
  <string id="3485">Sonic! We have to go!</string>
  <string id="3487">No! We have to stop Ix!</string>
  <string id="3488">There&apos;s no time!</string>
  <string id="3489">Everyone! Brace yourselves!</string>
  <string id="3591">There&apos;s someone trapped in that cave! And there&apos;s an Eggman signal coming from inside!</string>
  <string id="3592">Let&apos;s check it out.</string>
  <string id="3605">Look, Sonic! The robot&apos;s head looks like another Eggman device. Hm. I think I have all I need to... Yes!</string>
  <string id="3606">These fit together like so... and you clip this here... and connect this... Yay!</string>
  <string id="3607">The devices come together to form some kind of random pattern generator. I&apos;m not sure what it&apos;s for.</string>
  <string id="3609">We&apos;d better keep looking for Eggman. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="3611">Look, Sonic! The robot&apos;s head is another Eggman device. It must be old if it&apos;s forgotten its programming!</string>
  <string id="3612">Look, Sonic. The robot&apos;s head... it&apos;s an Eggman device!</string>
  <string id="3613">That must be what our tracker detected!</string>
  <string id="3614">Hm. I can&apos;t tell what it&apos;s used for. Maybe I can examine it some other time. </string>
  <string id="3770">Papa!</string>
  <string id="3771">Oh, son! We were so worried!</string>
  <string id="3772">Who are your friends?</string>
  <string id="3773">Papa, this is Sonic the Hedgehog, and these are his friends!</string>
  <string id="3774">Thank you ever so much for finding my boy. How can I ever repay you?</string>
  <string id="3775">Ah, yes! Take this!</string>
  <string id="3776">It&apos;s not much; just a token of my thanks for returning my precious boy!</string>
  <string id="3777">It was our pleasure, sir.</string>
  <string id="3778">Now, son, let&apos;s get you inside! Your mother will want to ground you, of course.</string>
  <string id="3779">But Papa....</string>
  <string id="3780">I live in Central City, so it&apos;s not too far away. </string>
  <string id="3781">Really?! I get to travel with Sonic the Hedgehog?!</string>
  <string id="3782">Wow, my friends will never believe this!</string>
  <string id="3783">I won&apos;t make a peep! I promise!</string>
  <string id="3784">I will! I promise!</string>
  <string id="3785">I don&apos;t know. I just thought it looked cool.</string>
  <string id="3786">I live in Emerald Town. My family must be very worried!</string>
  <string id="3787">Everyone&apos;s heard of you, Sonic! You&apos;re a hero!</string>
  <string id="3798">We&apos;ll take you there. Come with us. </string>
  <string id="3802">Well, be careful getting home, okay?</string>
  <string id="3804">Do you know what it does?</string>
  <string id="3817">There&apos;s that well. I bet Timmy&apos;s still down there!</string>
  <string id="3818">There&apos;s a well! I wonder if that&apos;s the one Timmy fell into.</string>
  <string id="3829">Ha! That&apos;s what you get for crossing GUN, robot scum!</string>
  <string id="3830">Thanks, Sonic, er, we can handle it from here. GUN appreciates your cooperation.</string>
  <string id="3831">Here is your reward for helping me in this mission. We&apos;ll be in touch if we need your help again!</string>
  <string id="3832">Take care, Sonic. And, er, stay out of trouble!</string>
  <string id="3835">Shh. Those robots are probably listening in. They&apos;re tricky!</string>
  <string id="3837">Hello again, Sonic. Be careful; that gang of robots is still at large. </string>
  <string id="3838">No! Don&apos;t hurt me!</string>
  <string id="3841">Really? You&apos;d do that? Wow, thanks!</string>
  <string id="3842">They have to be in Central City somewhere. If you find them, just wreck them for me!</string>
  <string id="3843">Then, when you&apos;re all done, I&apos;ll come in and, er, make sure they&apos;re all down. Right.</string>
  <string id="3844">Thanks, Sonic! This will be great!</string>
  <string id="3845">Not so bad?! I was given an easy job, to round up some robot muggers. And I can&apos;t even do that right!</string>
  <string id="3846">I&apos;m just terrible at this. I should have been a janitor like my mom said.</string>
  <string id="3847">Aww. Oh well. I guess I&apos;m on my own.</string>
  <string id="3851">Happy to help!</string>
  <string id="3865">There, there. It&apos;s not so bad.</string>
  <string id="3867">I&apos;ll shut those robots down.</string>
  <string id="3868">I don&apos;t have time for this.</string>
  <string id="3872">NEMESIS DETECTED. BEGIN COMBAT PROTOCOL.</string>
  <string id="3873">These must be the robots the GUN soldier told us to find!</string>
  <string id="3875">Let&apos;s smash &apos;em!</string>
  <string id="3893">Please... I need help.</string>
  <string id="3894">My name is Dr. Madden. I&apos;ve been... looking for these... signal projectors... here in Green Hill Zone.</string>
  <string id="3895">But I can&apos;t... ugh. Every time I try to find them... an animal attacks me.</string>
  <string id="3896">Oh, that&apos;s... wonderful!</string>
  <string id="3897">There are three signal projectors. If you see one... turn it off. That should make the animals... stop attacking.</string>
  <string id="3898">Come back to me... when you&apos;re done. I... I&apos;ll be here.</string>
  <string id="3899">Thank you so much. I just hope... it&apos;s not too late for the animals.</string>
  <string id="3900">I will... I just need to rest. I should be safe here.</string>
  <string id="3901">I noticed that the animals in Green Hill Zone were... acting strange, so I came to find out why.</string>
  <string id="3902">Little did I know... I would be attacked! They... came out of nowhere!</string>
  <string id="3903">But I think... I know what&apos;s wrong. Someone is... sending a signal, controlling the animals!</string>
  <string id="3904">If I could find the signal projectors... I could stop the signal!</string>
  <string id="3905">I believe so... yes. Ugh. Someone with powerful... technology. Like I&apos;ve never seen before.</string>
  <string id="3906">Everyone has. It&apos;s a terrible shame. </string>
  <string id="3910">I&apos;ll help you find them!</string>
  <string id="3913">We&apos;ll be back in no time!</string>
  <string id="3915">Will you be okay here?</string>
  <string id="3916">Why are you looking for them?</string>
  <string id="3921">Someone is controlling the animals?</string>
  <string id="3922">We&apos;ll help you find the signal projectors.</string>
  <string id="3923">We&apos;ve had trouble with the animals here, too. </string>
  <string id="3924">We&apos;d like to help you. </string>
  <string id="3925">Why are you looking for the projectors?</string>
  <string id="3928">Please... find the projectors, and shut them down!</string>
  <string id="3929">Hello again....</string>
  <string id="3930">Of... of course.</string>
  <string id="3931">Sorry, we&apos;ll be going now.</string>
  <string id="3933">That&apos;s the last of them! The animals should stop attacking people now!</string>
  <string id="3934">Let&apos;s go tell Dr. Madden!</string>
  <string id="3936">Sonic! This must be one of the projectors Dr. Madden was talking about!</string>
  <string id="3937">Let&apos;s shut it down!</string>
  <string id="3943">You did it! I knew it!</string>
  <string id="3944">An armadillo walked over to me, and it didn&apos;t attack! It was brilliant!</string>
  <string id="3946">Please take this. I brought supplies for my time out here, but thanks to you, I don&apos;t need them.</string>
  <string id="3947">I... I can make my own way home. Thank you so much for your help.</string>
  <string id="3948">I don&apos;t know for sure, but I have my suspicions.</string>
  <string id="3949">If you ask me, it&apos;s those blasted Marauders! They&apos;ve been causing trouble all over.</string>
  <string id="3950">I think they were using the animals to do their bidding. That&apos;s why they attacked me!</string>
  <string id="3951">Oh, I plan to... but I&apos;m so excited, I feel great!</string>
  <string id="3953">It was our pleasure.</string>
  <string id="3957">Do you know who was controlling the animals?</string>
  <string id="3961">Now, go get some medical help, mister!</string>
  <string id="3963">Help! Please!</string>
  <string id="3964">Oh, please, you must help me. We were attacked by Marauders! I barely escaped!</string>
  <string id="3965">I must get back to GUN Headquarters! Please!</string>
  <string id="3966">Thank you thank you thank you!</string>
  <string id="3967">If you could escort me as far as Station Square, I would be most grateful.</string>
  <string id="3968">I am an inspector with GUN, sent here to investigate rumors that the Marauders have taken Metropolis.</string>
  <string id="3969">Not long after we got here, though, we were attacked! </string>
  <string id="3970">I came here with a team of soldiers, but when we were attacked....</string>
  <string id="3971">I ran, okay? I got scared and ran away! That&apos;s right! Everyone laugh at the coward!</string>
  <string id="3972">Heh. Coward.</string>
  <string id="3973">But I really must get back. If this isn&apos;t evidence of the Marauders, I don&apos;t know what is!</string>
  <string id="3974">Hee hee hee! </string>
  <string id="3975">What? How come no one&apos;s laughing?</string>
  <string id="3976">Please! I beg you!</string>
  <string id="3979">Sure. Come with us.</string>
  <string id="3982">What are you doing out here? </string>
  <string id="3984">I see. Come with us, we&apos;ll help.</string>
  <string id="3985">Why do you keep saying &quot;we&quot;?</string>
  <string id="3991">Sorry. We&apos;re on an important mission.</string>
  <string id="3993">Finally! I&apos;m saved!</string>
  <string id="3995">You are a national hero, Sonic. A paragon of virtue!</string>
  <string id="3996">No doubt you will be commended with medals and trophies and piles and piles of cash for saving my life!</string>
  <string id="3998">Now, I must be off! Farewell, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="3999">Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="4000">What? That was funny!</string>
  <string id="4001">Hardly worth the time spent to save him.</string>
  <string id="4003">Let&apos;s get back to work, team!</string>
  <string id="4007">Happy to help!</string>
  <string id="4015">You did it! I&apos;m so relieved.</string>
  <string id="4017">Sonic! Help! I just realized that when I left work at the factory last night, I forgot to shut off the breakers.</string>
  <string id="4018">When the foreman switches on the main power today, it will blow out the grid!</string>
  <string id="4021">Oh, man. I am in big trouble now!</string>
  <string id="4022">What can I say? I&apos;m absentminded. What were we just talking about?</string>
  <string id="4023">Right. It&apos;s just north of here. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything that will slow you down...</string>
  <string id="4024">But I don&apos;t really remember.</string>
  <string id="4025">What are you still doing here?</string>
  <string id="4028">Don&apos;t worry, we&apos;ll take care of this!</string>
  <string id="4030">I&apos;m sorry. I don&apos;t have time to help you.</string>
  <string id="4032">You sound completely incompetent!</string>
  <string id="4033">I&apos;ll take care of this.</string>
  <string id="4034">Quick! Where&apos;s the factory?</string>
  <string id="4037">You aren&apos;t authorized to be here!</string>
  <string id="4039">I&apos;ll go reset the breakers before turning on main power.</string>
  <string id="4052">Thanks to you, I won&apos;t lose my job when I go in to work!</string>
  <string id="4053">Here. Take this. I was going to bribe my boss with it, but I don&apos;t really need it now.</string>
  <string id="4054">I&apos;d better get to work before I&apos;m fired for being late!</string>
  <string id="4055">Oh, great! You are a life saver!</string>
  <string id="4056">Come back and let me know how it went, okay?</string>
  <string id="4057">And please hurry!</string>
  <string id="4069">It was my pleasure!</string>
  <string id="4073">Why not?</string>
  <string id="4074">If you pull the switch, you&apos;ll blow up the whole factory!</string>
  <string id="4075">What?! </string>
  <string id="4076">Oh, for crying out loud. Did Johnson forget to close the breakers again?</string>
  <string id="4077">I tell you, that man would forget his head if it wasn&apos;t attached to his body.</string>
  <string id="4078">But you better believe that Johnson&apos;s getting a talking-to!</string>
  <string id="4079">Really? Who!?</string>
  <string id="4080">Oh no. I bet it was Johnson. He forgot to close the breakers again, didn&apos;t he?</string>
  <string id="4081">Why? What&apos;s this all about?</string>
  <string id="4088">Stop! Don&apos;t start the factory!</string>
  <string id="4096">One of your workers asked us to stop you!</string>
  <string id="4099">Oh, then go right ahead and pull the switch.</string>
  <string id="4108">Ah. It&apos;s so nice without those wasps. </string>
  <string id="4109">You did it! I think the wasps are gone!</string>
  <string id="4110">Thank you so much. I guess I won&apos;t be needing this anymore! Take care, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="4111">Please, find the queen! The wasps are everywhere!</string>
  <string id="4112">Oh, it&apos;s you again. </string>
  <string id="4113">Change your mind, did you?</string>
  <string id="4114">No! They&apos;ll get me!</string>
  <string id="4115">Help! Someone, help!</string>
  <string id="4116">There are giant wasps all over the rooftops! They&apos;re attacking anyone who goes up there!</string>
  <string id="4117">There must be a queen wasp up there somewhere. If someone were to defeat her, the wasps might go away.</string>
  <string id="4118">Please hurry! They&apos;re everywhere!</string>
  <string id="4119">Because I... well... because they&apos;re ROOFTOPS!</string>
  <string id="4120">Everybody goes on the rooftops! What kind of question is that?</string>
  <string id="4121">No! Please! They&apos;ll get me!</string>
  <string id="4122">All in a day&apos;s work!</string>
  <string id="4125">How do we get rid of the wasps?</string>
  <string id="4126">No, not really.</string>
  <string id="4128">How can we help?</string>
  <string id="4131">Why would you go on the rooftops?</string>
  <string id="4133">Sorry, we&apos;re too busy to help. </string>
  <string id="4175">Is everyone okay?</string>
  <string id="4176">A little... shaken up... but we&apos;re here.</string>
  <string id="4177">What happened?</string>
  <string id="4178">Ix got away. He took the Master Emerald.</string>
  <string id="4179">Without the Emerald, Angel Island fell. We&apos;ve lost.</string>
  <string id="4180">Ix has won.</string>
  <string id="4181">We can&apos;t give up! We have to....</string>
  <string id="4183">Look!</string>
  <string id="4185">Lord Ix&apos;s plan. It has begun.</string>
  <string id="4186">And there&apos;s nothing we can do to stop it.</string>
  <string id="4202">I have been imprisoned in the Twilight Cage for too long! Soon I will break free and shake the foundation of the universe!</string>
  <string id="4206">Ix has taken the Master Emerald back inside the Twilight Cage.</string>
  <string id="4207">Your world is lost.</string>
  <string id="4208">I hope you are right. </string>
  <string id="4209">Hm. A wormhole in the sky, directly above Metropolis....</string>
  <string id="4210">My lab filled with old starship parts, just waiting to be put to good use....</string>
  <string id="4211">Are you thinking what I&apos;m thinking?</string>
  <string id="4212">Oh, most certainly!</string>
  <string id="4213">Oh please. This isn&apos;t the time for nerd bonding.</string>
  <string id="4215">Well, being the utterly unparalleled genius I am, I happen to have set aside rocket parts for just this sort of occasion.</string>
  <string id="4216">I&apos;ve designed them to be simple enough that even Tails here could help me put them together!</string>
  <string id="4217">And this will work for sure?</string>
  <string id="4218">Absolutely! I even have a Dimensional Buffer stored away! Perfect!</string>
  <string id="4219">Of course! It should be simple.</string>
  <string id="4220">There is the small matter that a massive floating island crashed into my city, knocking out my power grid!</string>
  <string id="4221">My lovely, beautiful power grid!</string>
  <string id="4222">So even if we got all the parts for the ship, we couldn&apos;t put it together without power.</string>
  <string id="4223">Oh, and it seems the crash has broken open my Hazard Vault. </string>
  <string id="4224">So, I wouldn&apos;t worry too much, but it&apos;s likely that mad robots are running amuck as we speak.</string>
  <string id="4225">Oh. Is that all?</string>
  <string id="4226">Sonic, Eggman and I will go to his lab and start gathering parts. </string>
  <string id="4227">If you can get the power grid back up, we can get the spaceship up and ready in no time!</string>
  <string id="4228">I will go with the hedgehog.</string>
  <string id="4229">Yeah!</string>
  <string id="4230">There are three generators that supply power to my lab. I&apos;ll mark them on your map.</string>
  <string id="4231">If you can activate them all, then I...er, WE can get to work on that spaceship.</string>
  <string id="4232">We will not fail.</string>
  <string id="4233">....</string>
  <string id="4234">Good luck, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="4235">Oh, just some prototype robots, old machines I never used because they were too unpredictable. </string>
  <string id="4236">Certainly Sonic the Hedgehog has nothing to fear from them!</string>
  <string id="4237">I beg you for the chance to prove myself, my new friend.</string>
  <string id="4238">When Ix cast me aside, I made up my mind to oppose him. I cannot trust him with my people. </string>
  <string id="4239">I would never want my people to return at the expense of the people of this world. </string>
  <string id="4241">Give her a shot, Sonic. I&apos;ll take responsibility if she turns on us.</string>
  <string id="4245">Of course! After all the times I&apos;ve tried to take over the world, you think I wouldn&apos;t have mere rocket parts around?</string>
  <string id="4246">Ha! You know nothing of the true genius of Eggman!</string>
  <string id="4247">Of course not! What challenge would there be, then?</string>
  <string id="4248">Ix hoped to use their power to return our clan to this world. At least, that was what he told us. Now I know he is using my people for his own selfish ends.</string>
  <string id="4252">Then the legends are true.</string>
  <string id="4253">It would seem so, although I have never heard them.</string>
  <string id="4254">The Nocturnus Clan of echidnas ruled much of the world some 4000 years ago. They were only rivaled by my ancestors, led by Pachacamac.</string>
  <string id="4256">The Nocturnus Clan disappeared not long after Perfect Chaos nearly destroyed my people. We always thought Perfect Chaos destroyed them, too.</string>
  <string id="4257">So now Ix has taken the Master Emerald as part of his plan to conquer the world.</string>
  <string id="4258">I thought I was helping my people return from exile. I didn&apos;t know Lord Ix planned to conquer this world. I... I was blind.</string>
  <string id="4260">I can&apos;t expect you to believe me. I just want a chance to get back at Lord Ix for using my people as a weapon.</string>
  <string id="4262">We&apos;ll find a way to stop him.</string>
  <string id="4268">What are you two going on about?</string>
  <string id="4273">Then let&apos;s get that rocket built!</string>
  <string id="4283">Then we have a plan. Let&apos;s get moving!</string>
  <string id="4290">What was in the Hazard Vault?</string>
  <string id="4292">I don&apos;t want to work with Shade.</string>
  <string id="4300">You just happened to have these parts lying around?</string>
  <string id="4302">Let&apos;s just get the rocket built.</string>
  <string id="4303">It can&apos;t be this easy. </string>
  <string id="4305">What is Ix up to? Why does he need the Emeralds?</string>
  <string id="4311">We&apos;ll find a way to stop Ix.</string>
  <string id="4312">What legends?</string>
  <string id="4316">Why should we believe anything you say?</string>
  <string id="4321">Finally. The last generator.</string>
  <string id="4324">That ought to do it. Let&apos;s get back to Tails.</string>
  <string id="4329">Tails, there goes the second generator.</string>
  <string id="4335">Tails, we activated one of the generators.</string>
  <string id="4368">Sonic! I heard something over your communicator! Is everything all right?</string>
  <string id="4369">You are destined to face Lord Ix, Sonic. I could not watch you be defeated by a lowly robot.</string>
  <string id="4370">Of course. </string>
  <string id="4371">Shall we continue?</string>
  <string id="4372">Sonic, we have power!</string>
  <string id="4373">But there&apos;s a problem. Eggman&apos;s Dimensional Buffer is in the Hazard Vault. </string>
  <string id="4374">Without that, the spaceship would never withstand the rigors of dimensional travel!</string>
  <string id="4375">Then you would rather have died?</string>
  <string id="4376">I didn&apos;t want to take that chance. </string>
  <string id="4378">Thank you, Shade.</string>
  <string id="4383">That was a stupid thing to do!</string>
  <string id="4385">You don&apos;t think I could handle that shot?</string>
  <string id="4393">You impress me, Sonic the Hedgehog.</string>
  <string id="4394">I don&apos;t waste time with flattery. It&apos;s not easy to impress me. Thus far, only you and your echidna friend have done so. </string>
  <string id="4395">I worked with Lord Ix for a very long time. He has led my people for as long as we can remember.</string>
  <string id="4396">But faced with his wrath, you and your friends stand up against him. You risk everything in a desperate attempt to stop him.</string>
  <string id="4398">I find that... inspiring.</string>
  <string id="4399">She was acting under orders, Sonic. This isn&apos;t her fault.</string>
  <string id="4400">No, he&apos;s right. I was blind, and now my people are stuck serving a vicious and cruel master.</string>
  <string id="4401">I understand. With luck, I will get a chance to make up for my crimes.</string>
  <string id="4402">We have a lot to do. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="4403">He is. And as powerful as Lord Ix is alone, he is surrounded by advanced technology and the finest warriors of my clan.</string>
  <string id="4404">We have a difficult fight ahead of us, Sonic. I go with you knowing that Ix will most likely kill me. </string>
  <string id="4405">Not as long as I live.</string>
  <string id="4406">Bravery worthy of Pachacamac&apos;s descendant. I am proud to work with you all. </string>
  <string id="4407">Thank you. From you, that is a compliment.</string>
  <string id="4408">And I would understand if we never were. But I give respect where it is due.</string>
  <string id="4409">There&apos;s no time for flattery, Shade. </string>
  <string id="4411">Why is that?</string>
  <string id="4415">It&apos;s just what we do.</string>
  <string id="4416">I consider all this to be your fault, Shade.</string>
  <string id="4421">Is he really that powerful?</string>
  <string id="4426">You&apos;re not so bad yourself.</string>
  <string id="4428">We are not friends, Shade. </string>
  <string id="4430">Ha ha ha ha! You *bzt* cannot...</string>
  <string id="4431">Defeat... meeeeeeee *bzt*</string>
  <string id="4432">You could have fooled me.</string>
  <string id="4433">Come. We have the Dimensional Buffer. Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="4434">Ha ha ha ha ha! *bzt*</string>
  <string id="4435">I am *bzt* free! Free to destroy!</string>
  <string id="4436">*bzt* Destroy... you.... *bzt* Ha ha ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="4437">*bzt* A hedgehog in *bzt* running shoes. *bzt* Disgusting!</string>
  <string id="4438">Ha ha ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="4439">*bzt* Beauty.... Genius.... *bzt* Perfect creation!</string>
  <string id="4440">None... *bzt* in my way... *bzt* None *bzt* defeat me!</string>
  <string id="4446">Let&apos;s take it down, team!</string>
  <string id="4448">Ugh! A robot Eggman. Disgusting!</string>
  <string id="4450">What in the world are you?</string>
  <string id="4453">Great! Once we have the Dimensional Buffer, we can take off after Ix!</string>
  <string id="4454">Eggman says he thinks most of the robots will have escaped already.</string>
  <string id="4455">It should be a matter of just going in and getting the part!</string>
  <string id="4456">I&apos;m sure you can handle anything else that&apos;s in there!</string>
  <string id="4457">We&apos;re not quite done getting the ship together. If you can get the last part, we can get all this done sooner.</string>
  <string id="4458">Then we&apos;re on our way!</string>
  <string id="4460">Anything we should be looking out for?</string>
  <string id="4462">Why do I doubt it&apos;ll be that easy?</string>
  <string id="4463">Why doesn&apos;t Eggman go get it himself?</string>
  <string id="4464">This must be the Hazard Vault.</string>
  <string id="4465">Let&apos;s go. The part we need is inside.</string>
  <string id="4466">This should be easy enough. This place looks pretty empty.</string>
  <string id="4470">Sonic! It&apos;s Tails! </string>
  <string id="4471">Eggman says there may be a few more robots in the Hazard Vault!</string>
  <string id="4475">He&apos;s apologizing. And laughing. But mostly apologizing.</string>
  <string id="4476">Yeah, I know. Risk of working with an evil genius, I guess.</string>
  <string id="4478">It&apos;s almost over, Sonic. Good luck!</string>
  <string id="4489">Don&apos;t worry. We can handle it!</string>
  <string id="4493">Eggman and his stupid robots!</string>
  <string id="4530">Okay! I think we&apos;re all set to go!</string>
  <string id="4531">We have a few minutes before the dimensional window cycles around.</string>
  <string id="4532">Feel free to take a moment and talk to everyone if you like. </string>
  <string id="4534">All right!</string>
  <string id="4535">Everyone, we&apos;re leaving right now! Gather your things and get on the ship!</string>
  <string id="4536">Good luck out there, now. Without my genius working for you, you&apos;re in for quite a fight!</string>
  <string id="4537">Wait, Eggman. You&apos;re not going?</string>
  <string id="4538">Oh, no. You&apos;ll need someone to help you with re-entry when you come back!</string>
  <string id="4539">Inter-dimensional travel isn&apos;t like dusting crops, boy! You&apos;ll need someone of supreme intellect to guide you back in!</string>
  <string id="4540">Oh no you don&apos;t, Sonic! You&apos;ll not insult me, not when I&apos;m volunteering to--</string>
  <string id="4541">Oh. Oh! My, did you just thank me?</string>
  <string id="4542">Or, at least, a bigger head.</string>
  <string id="4543">Finally, you appreciate my genius. Well, you&apos;re welcome.</string>
  <string id="4544">Final boarding call for the Twilight Cage!</string>
  <string id="4545">We&apos;re leaving. Everyone coming? </string>
  <string id="4546">On our way!</string>
  <string id="4548">Thanks for all your help, Eggman. I really mean it!</string>
  <string id="4549">Aw, it was all you, my little friend! Now, go on!</string>
  <string id="4550">Goodbye!</string>
  <string id="4553">Sure. Take your time.</string>
  <string id="4554">Come talk to me when you&apos;re ready to go.</string>
  <string id="4556">Sonic! Are you okay?</string>
  <string id="4557">We&apos;re fine. Just had to deal with one of Eggman&apos;s old friends.</string>
  <string id="4558">He was such a handsome devil. *sniff*</string>
  <string id="4559">We have the Dimensional Buffer now. We should be ready to go.</string>
  <string id="4560">Great! Meet us in Eggman&apos;s lab, and we&apos;ll get everything ready!</string>
  <string id="4561">Tails out!</string>
  <string id="4565">There&apos;s no time to waste. Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="4571">That sounds fair. Thank you for your help, Eggman.</string>
  <string id="4573">Don&apos;t get a big head about it</string>
  <string id="4585">We could really use you out there. </string>
  <string id="4586">Well, good riddance, I say.</string>
  <string id="4587">I&apos;m not sure we should trust him here all alone....</string>
  <string id="4588">I&apos;ll only need a moment.</string>
  <string id="4592">How do you feel about all this?</string>
  <string id="4600">Hey Sonic! Are you ready to take off for the Twilight Cage?</string>
  <string id="4601">Oh, no! Without someone of my brilliance here to guide you, there&apos;s no telling where you&apos;ll end up!</string>
  <string id="4602">Besides, someone should be here in case Ix decides to come through while you&apos;re gone, no?</string>
  <string id="4603">Oh, Sonic! Get in touch with your feelings, my boy! </string>
  <string id="4604">You&apos;ll miss having me to match wits with, I promise you!</string>
  <string id="4605">Ha ha ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="4606">Come now, Sonic. What could I possibly get up to here? </string>
  <string id="4607">My city is in ruins, my machines destroyed. I am a broken man, left only with the finest mind the world has ever known!</string>
  <string id="4608">Go. Go without worry, my blue friend! Ha ha ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="4609">It feels odd to say this, but I&apos;m excited! We&apos;re going to another world! Sure we might not escape, but....</string>
  <string id="4611">Besides, we have to do this. We can&apos;t just let  Ix have the Chaos Emeralds!</string>
  <string id="4612">Not much. Just that Shade&apos;s clan came from there. She ought to know more than I do.</string>
  <string id="4614">Yes. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="4615">I need a little more time.</string>
  <string id="4625">You&apos;re right. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="4626">I&apos;ll be ready to go soon. </string>
  <string id="4627">Do you know anything about the Twilight Cage?</string>
  <string id="4629">I think it&apos;s time to get going.</string>
  <string id="4672">What is this place?</string>
  <string id="4673">I don&apos;t know. Looks like some kind of rock planet.</string>
  <string id="4674">This is the home colony of the Kron. They are allies of Lord Ix.</string>
  <string id="4675">Sonic, we have a problem. The ship landed all right, but we&apos;re completely out of power, and I think the Dimensional Buffer is shot.</string>
  <string id="4676">Are you saying we&apos;re stranded here? </string>
  <string id="4677">Well, not exactly. If we can find one of the Chaos Emeralds, we can use it to power the Cyclone.</string>
  <string id="4679">Right! We should explore this place, and see what we can find.</string>
  <string id="4681">Hm. I think the Kron might have a different idea.</string>
  <string id="4682">Get ready, team!</string>
  <string id="4683">Next to nothing. It seems to be made of rock and metal, but I can&apos;t tell much else. </string>
  <string id="4684">There does seem to be a Chaos Emerald here. That should be enough to power the Cyclone.</string>
  <string id="4685">Lord Ix must have planted one of the Chaos Emeralds here. Maybe he didn&apos;t want to keep them all in one place. </string>
  <string id="4687">Well, we came here for a Chaos Emerald. Let&apos;s not waste our time talking.</string>
  <string id="4688">They are a race of miners and builders. The finest in all of the Twilight Cage.</string>
  <string id="4689">Lord Ix uses them to build his armor, weapons, and other machines.</string>
  <string id="4690">They are strong and persistent. Very dangerous in a fight. </string>
  <string id="4691">You must understand. Lord Ix rules this place. Those who wouldn&apos;t work with him, he destroyed. </string>
  <string id="4692">That&apos;s a nice thought, but I wouldn&apos;t hold my breath. </string>
  <string id="4695">Then they&apos;re enemies of Sonic the Hedgehog.</string>
  <string id="4699">Then let&apos;s go get it!</string>
  <string id="4704">Do you know anything about this place?</string>
  <string id="4706">That&apos;s awfully convenient.</string>
  <string id="4710">Shade, what do you know about the Kron?</string>
  <string id="4713">They haven&apos;t fought us yet.</string>
  <string id="4714">Why would they work for Ix?</string>
  <string id="4715">Then maybe we can turn them against him.</string>
  <string id="4721">Knuckles is missing! He was kidnapped by the Marauders, a gang of criminals who have been stealing the Chaos Emeralds!&#13;
&#13;
Sonic must find Amy Rose and go with her to Tails&apos; Workshop in Central City, just south of Green Hill Zone.</string>
  <string id="4722">Hostile Reception</string>
  <string id="4729">Help the woodsman by chopping some wood.&#13;
&#13;
An elderly woodsman asked Sonic for his help. The poor man has been out chopping wood all day, and he&apos;s getting tired! If Sonic would just chop one piece of wood, the woodsman would be eternally grateful!</string>
  <string id="4730">Sonic took a moment out of his busy schedule to chop a little wood and help out the poor old woodsman. What a nice guy!</string>
  <string id="4731">Speak with the woodsman for a reward.&#13;
&#13;
Sonic raised the axe and chopped a piece of wood neatly in half. All that remains is to speak with the nearby woodsman about a job well done!</string>
  <string id="4732">The Tired Old Woodsman</string>
  <string id="4744">Knuckles is missing! He was kidnapped by the Marauders, a gang of criminals who have been stealing the Chaos Emeralds!&#13;
&#13;
Amy Rose and Sonic must get to Tails&apos; Workshop in Central City, just south of Green Hill Zone.</string>
  <string id="4748">Knuckles is missing! He was kidnapped by the Marauders, a gang of criminals who have been stealing the Chaos Emeralds!&#13;
&#13;
Sonic and Amy Rose have arrived in Central City. Now they must go see Tails in his Workshop.</string>
  <string id="4750">Knuckles is missing! He was kidnapped by the Marauders, a gang of criminals who have been stealing the Chaos Emeralds!&#13;
&#13;
Sonic and Amy found Tails! Tails contacted GUN, the Guardian Unit of Nations, for help in finding Knuckles. Sonic, Amy, and Tails must go speak to GUN Commander and see what can be done to find Knuckles.&#13;
&#13;
Speak to Tails when you&apos;re ready to go!</string>
  <string id="4751">Knuckles is missing! He was kidnapped by the Marauders, a gang of criminals who have been stealing the Chaos Emeralds!&#13;
&#13;
Tails contacted GUN, the Guardian Unit of Nations, for help in finding Knuckles. Sonic, Amy, and Tails must go speak to GUN Commander and see what can be done to find Knuckles.</string>
  <string id="4755">Could Eggman really be back? Could he be behind Knuckles&apos; disappearance?&#13;
&#13;
Sonic thought he had defeated Eggman in their last battle, but the robots that attacked sure looked like Eggman&apos;s minions... old and worn-out they may have been. &#13;
&#13;
GUN Commander would love to hear about this. Go to Central City and speak with him.</string>
  <string id="4760">Knuckles is missing! He was kidnapped by the Marauders, a gang of criminals who have been stealing the Chaos Emeralds!&#13;
&#13;
Sonic and Amy Rose have arrived in Central City. They met up with Rouge, who said that she wouldn&apos;t take them to GUN Headquarters without Tails. Now Sonic and Amy must go find Tails in his workshop.</string>
  <string id="4763">Knuckles is missing! He was kidnapped by the Marauders, a gang of criminals who have been stealing the Chaos Emeralds!&#13;
&#13;
Sonic, Tails, and Amy met up with Rouge, who was waiting to take them to the GUN Headquarters to speak with GUN Commander.</string>
  <string id="4764">Are we really going to fly in that? It doesn&apos;t look safe.</string>
  <string id="4765">I&apos;m-- I&apos;m not afraid to fly, Sonic! I just don&apos;t think that plane looks up to code, is all.</string>
  <string id="4766">If you&apos;re there with me, I know I&apos;ll be all right. We can handle it together.</string>
  <string id="4767">I can&apos;t wait to meet up with those Marauders. I&apos;ll show them a thing or two!</string>
  <string id="4768">Dexter? Oh, yes. He won&apos;t mind. He wouldn&apos;t want me riding in a dangerous airplane without an escort, you see.</string>
  <string id="4772">Oh, yes, all the time. His plane is magnificent!</string>
  <string id="4775">Hmph! Why would I do that? Ha ha ha! That makes no sense, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="4776">You&apos;re so funny. But not as funny as my Dexter!</string>
  <string id="4777">Oh, I&apos;m just fine! Why wouldn&apos;t I be?</string>
  <string id="4784">Yes, we&apos;re going soon. Be ready.</string>
  <string id="4785">Are you afraid to fly? Since when?</string>
  <string id="4787">Good. We&apos;re leaving soon. Be ready.</string>
  <string id="4789">What about Dexter?</string>
  <string id="4793">We&apos;re leaving soon. Be ready.</string>
  <string id="4794">Doesn&apos;t Dexter take you flying sometimes?</string>
  <string id="4797">Now I -know- you&apos;re making him up.</string>
  <string id="4799">How are you doing, Amy?</string>
  <string id="4816">Was that...?</string>
  <string id="4817">That animal seemed to be... roboticized.</string>
  <string id="4818">Oh no! Poor thing!</string>
  <string id="4819">Looks like we were right about Eggman being involved.</string>
  <string id="4820">But the animals... oh no!</string>
  <string id="4821">It&apos;s okay, Cream. We will find Eggman and stop him.</string>
  <string id="4822">The signal doesn&apos;t stop here, Sonic. We have to keep following it to find the source.</string>
  <string id="4823">Then let&apos;s go. Eggman will pay for this.</string>
  <string id="4824">I don&apos;t understand. How could Angel Island move away?</string>
  <string id="4825">How can Angel Island float?</string>
  <string id="4826">Point taken, smarty.</string>
  <string id="4828">But how can we stop him? We don&apos;t even know where he is!</string>
  <string id="4829">I think I can help with that!</string>
  <string id="4831">These communicators we found are old Eggman technology. They were made only to respond to a special frequency that Eggman used.</string>
  <string id="4832">If I can rewire them once again, maybe we can reverse them and use them to detect that frequency!</string>
  <string id="4833">So we could use them to find Eggman!</string>
  <string id="4835">This is a waste of time.</string>
  <string id="4837">If Eggman has all of the Chaos Emeralds, he won&apos;t stop there. He&apos;ll go after the Master Emerald. On Angel Island.</string>
  <string id="4838">If Eggman&apos;s going to Angel Island, then so should we.</string>
  <string id="4839">Right! In the meantime, everyone rest up. We have to be ready to fight if we&apos;re going after Eggman.</string>
  <string id="4841">Sonic, just head outside when you&apos;re ready to go. It won&apos;t take me long to rewire the communicators!</string>
  <string id="4842">It should. The communicators are already made to detect Eggman&apos;s electronic signature.</string>
  <string id="4843">It&apos;s a simple matter to rewire them so they&apos;ll alert us when we get close.</string>
  <string id="4844">That would be good news, wouldn&apos;t it?</string>
  <string id="4845">Besides, even if he isn&apos;t, we know his machines are. If we find more of his robots, we might learn more about what&apos;s going on.</string>
  <string id="4846">But... I....</string>
  <string id="4847">When we defeated Eggman the last time, it looked like he was gone for good.</string>
  <string id="4849">I don&apos;t think he could have recovered that much in so short a time.</string>
  <string id="4850">Then he&apos;ll be easier to defeat this time.</string>
  <string id="4853">Hey, if Eggman has the seven Chaos Emeralds, I say we go get him now. </string>
  <string id="4854">He&apos;s bound to have something shiny we can... rescue.</string>
  <string id="4855">I have an idea!</string>
  <string id="4857">....</string>
  <string id="4858">....</string>
  <string id="4859">Er.... Group hug?</string>
  <string id="4870">This has to be Eggman&apos;s doing. We have to stop him.</string>
  <string id="4873">Have you found something?</string>
  <string id="4882">Build the tracker, Tails. We need to find Eggman now.</string>
  <string id="4886">Do you think this tracker will work, Tails?</string>
  <string id="4888">Then let&apos;s build it. We have to stop Eggman.</string>
  <string id="4889">But what if Eggman isn&apos;t out there?</string>
  <string id="4891">I agree with Knuckles. We should go to Angel Island.</string>
  <string id="4910">GUN Commander gave Sonic a map showing the locations of four Eggman hideouts. Sonic must check out each hideout and figure out where the Marauders are holding Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="4911">GUN Commander gave Sonic a map showing the locations of four Eggman hideouts. The team found the first hideout. Now they must search inside for Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="4912">The Search for Knuckles</string>
  <string id="4913">I&apos;m ready when you are, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="4914">Ugh. It&apos;s called &quot;a shower&quot;, people. You might want to look into it.</string>
  <string id="4915">That&apos;s not us, Rouge. It&apos;s...</string>
  <string id="4916">It&apos;s coming from over there! Look!</string>
  <string id="4917">Some kind of gas cloud. I wonder where it came from.</string>
  <string id="4918">Ugh. That stuff smells horrible!</string>
  <string id="4919">It&apos;s not just stinky; that gas might be deadly!</string>
  <string id="4920">Maybe there&apos;s a way around. I....</string>
  <string id="4922">What&apos;s that?</string>
  <string id="4923">I don&apos;t know, but it&apos;s coming from the cloud!</string>
  <string id="4924">Ready to fight, team!</string>
  <string id="4927">I&apos;ll be ready, darlin&apos;. Don&apos;t you worry about me. </string>
  <string id="4928">Hey, Big Blue. Whatcha need?</string>
  <string id="4929">I&apos;ll be ready, darlin&apos;. Don&apos;t you worry about me. </string>
  <string id="4930">I&apos;m fine. Ready as I&apos;ll ever be.</string>
  <string id="4931">There had better be something shiny in this place we&apos;re going. Knuckles is cute, but he&apos;s not much of a reward.</string>
  <string id="4932">Boy, you sure are good at detecting sarcasm, aren&apos;t you?</string>
  <string id="4947">We&apos;re leaving soon. Be ready.</string>
  <string id="4948">How are you, Rouge?</string>
  <string id="4950">You think Knuckles is cute?</string>
  <string id="4953">Whew. Sorry about the bumpy landing, team. This fog is so thick, I can hardly see to land!</string>
  <string id="4954">Mystic Ruins? More like &quot;Soggy Ruins,&quot; if you ask me. Ew.</string>
  <string id="4955">The ruins should be to the east. Let&apos;s go find Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="4956">Ready to go save Knuckles?</string>
  <string id="4957">The Tornado&apos;s right outside. Head out there and interact with the plane when you&apos;re ready to travel!</string>
  <string id="4962">I had hoped to get by without her. She&apos;s not really up to spec.</string>
  <string id="4963">But it looks like we have no choice but to take the Tornado out for a spin!</string>
  <string id="4964">It&apos;ll get us there. I&apos;m just not sure it&apos;ll get us back.</string>
  <string id="4965">I&apos;ll need some time to adjust the flaps, if you want to rest a moment. </string>
  <string id="4967">I had to use some of her parts for the trap I built for Knuckles. Those parts were destroyed when the trap blew up.</string>
  <string id="4968">She should fly all right, but I wouldn&apos;t go too far with her. Not without some serious work on her stabilizers!</string>
  <string id="4969">I can&apos;t be sure but, I can hope.</string>
  <string id="4970">If the signal leads to a headquarters, then we&apos;ll probably find Knuckles there. </string>
  <string id="4971">If not, well, I hope we can get some clue that will help us find him!</string>
  <string id="4972">Right!</string>
  <string id="4973">Hey Sonic! Got something! Another communicator!</string>
  <string id="4974">And still no Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="4975">I think I... Yes! I&apos;ve got it!</string>
  <string id="4979">I&apos;ve rewired the communicators and.... There! I&apos;ve got the source of the signal!</string>
  <string id="4980">It&apos;s there! In the Mystic Ruins!</string>
  <string id="4981">That must be where they&apos;re keeping Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="4982">I bet it&apos;s another wild goose chase. Count me out.</string>
  <string id="4983">Fine. You twisted my arm.</string>
  <string id="4984">Let&apos;s hurry! The Mystic Ruins are just south of Central City. We&apos;ll get there if we follow the road.</string>
  <string id="4985">Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="4986">Then we&apos;ll have to go back to GUN and see if they know anything else.</string>
  <string id="4987">I really hope that doesn&apos;t happen. I don&apos;t trust GUN.</string>
  <string id="4988">Er, no offense, Rouge. </string>
  <string id="4989">No, that&apos;s fair.</string>
  <string id="4990">Er... what? The Chaos Emeralds?</string>
  <string id="4991">Ah, yes. Let&apos;s get moving, then! Knuckles could be in trouble, you know! No time to lose!</string>
  <string id="4992">Hey Sonic! Look!</string>
  <string id="4993">Another communicator! Almost enough to build the signal tracker!</string>
  <string id="4994">Where could they be keeping Knuckles? Could there be somewhere else that GUN couldn&apos;t find?</string>
  <string id="4995">Let&apos;s keep looking and find out!</string>
  <string id="4996">Another communicator. And it&apos;s broken, too. </string>
  <string id="4997">You know, Sonic, if we found more of these, I might be able to rewire them and use them to trace the source of the signal.</string>
  <string id="4998">With that, we might be able to find the Marauders&apos; headquarters, where they&apos;re probably keeping Knuckles.</string>
  <string id="4999">Well, he&apos;s not here. And all we&apos;re finding are stupid walkie-talkies. </string>
  <string id="5000">We&apos;ll find him. I know it!</string>
  <string id="5001">Let&apos;s keep moving.</string>
  <string id="5002">I found some sort of device. I think it&apos;s a communicator!</string>
  <string id="5004">Hm. It seems broken. But maybe if we had more parts, I could get it working.</string>
  <string id="5005">Knuckles isn&apos;t here. He must be in one of the other hideouts.</string>
  <string id="5006">Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="5007">Hey, team! Look!</string>
  <string id="5008">This is the last of the hideouts. Maybe we&apos;ll find Knuckles inside!</string>
  <string id="5009">Another hideout! Let&apos;s look around!</string>
  <string id="5010">Another hideout! Let&apos;s look around!</string>
  <string id="5011">Here&apos;s one of the hideouts we&apos;re supposed to explore.</string>
  <string id="5012">It looks abandoned! There&apos;s no one here!</string>
  <string id="5013">Looks can be deceiving, Pinky. There could be something valuable in there.</string>
  <string id="5014">You mean like Knuckles?</string>
  <string id="5015">Mmm. Right. Like Knuckles.</string>
  <string id="5026">If it&apos;ll help us save Knuckles, it&apos;s good enough for me.</string>
  <string id="5030">Why haven&apos;t we been using the Tornado all along?</string>
  <string id="5032">Are you sure we&apos;re looking for Knuckles in the right place?</string>
  <string id="5035">Then get the Tornado ready so we can save Knuckles.</string>
  <string id="5045">You&apos;re probably right.</string>
  <string id="5046">Let&apos;s just go check it out.</string>
  <string id="5050">And what if he&apos;s not there?</string>
  <string id="5055">Maybe that&apos;s where they&apos;re keeping the Chaos Emeralds, too.</string>
  <string id="5077">Amy!!!</string>
  <string id="5078">Ugh! No hugs, Big. Not while you smell like that.</string>
  <string id="5079">What are you doing here, Big?</string>
  <string id="5080">Uh, I was just fishing in the lake over there, and I thought I heard my friend Amy Rose!</string>
  <string id="5081">I was so happy I splashed through the lake and came over here, and there she was! Amy Rose!</string>
  <string id="5082">How did you get through that gas, Big? It seems very dangerous!</string>
  <string id="5083">Oh, that? That&apos;s the sneezy fog! It makes me sneeze.</string>
  <string id="5084">Ah-ah-ah... ah-CHOO!</string>
  <string id="5085">Ugh. I&apos;d almost rather stand in the fog.</string>
  <string id="5086">Sonic, Big is an old friend of mine. I think we should bring him along!</string>
  <string id="5087">Yay! I go with Amy Rose!</string>
  <string id="5088">Now we just need to get through that fog.</string>
  <string id="5089">Big can help with that!</string>
  <string id="5091">Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="5092">Poison gas?! Oh no! Where?</string>
  <string id="5094">I think maybe it just doesn&apos;t affect him, Sonic. Big is pretty tough.</string>
  <string id="5095">Maybe he can help us get past this gas and into the ruins!</string>
  <string id="5096">Definitely. He&apos;s just the sweetest!</string>
  <string id="5097">Sure! If he can survive the gas, maybe he can get us through it!</string>
  <string id="5098">Hmph. The more the merrier, I always say.</string>
  <string id="5108">It can&apos;t hurt anything, I guess.</string>
  <string id="5114">How did you survive the poison gas, Big?</string>
  <string id="5118">Does everyone think Big should come with us?</string>
  <string id="5121">Then come with us, Big. We could use your help.</string>
  <string id="5122">Why, I&apos;ll let you have it if you bring me that stapler! It belonged to my sainted mother, rest her soul.</string>
  <string id="5124">Why are we standing here? We should be off finding Eggman.</string>
  <string id="5125">I can&apos;t believe Eggman might really be back!</string>
  <string id="5126">We keep beating him up, and he keeps returning. I wonder if it&apos;ll ever end!</string>
  <string id="5216">All right! Everyone, gather around!</string>
  <string id="5217">This tracker won&apos;t lead us right to Eggman, but it will beep when we get near him!</string>
  <string id="5218">We&apos;ll have to travel all over. When the tracker starts beeping, we&apos;ll know we&apos;re close.</string>
  <string id="5219">I&apos;ve tuned it to Eggman&apos;s electronic signature, so any Eggman device that&apos;s out there might make it beep.</string>
  <string id="5220">Those things might be clues, so we should check out anything that makes the tracker beep!</string>
  <string id="5221">Look out, Eggman! We&apos;re coming for you!</string>
  <string id="5222">Eggman could be anywhere! We should search Green Hill Zone, Central City, and Mystic Ruins.</string>
  <string id="5223">Any time the tracker beeps, we should look around. It could be Eggman!</string>
  <string id="5224">Right! He should be pretty weak, but even a weak Eggman is dangerous!</string>
  <string id="5322">Good. Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="5324">So, where should we look?</string>
  <string id="5326">And when we find Eggman, we take him out.</string>
  <string id="5335">Ha. Marauders.</string>
  <string id="5336">I hoped I&apos;d get a chance to bring down a few of these guys.</string>
  <string id="5337">Let&apos;s take &apos;em out.</string>
  <string id="5338">I wish I were there with you. I&apos;d love to take down a few of those guys.</string>
  <string id="5339">Take &apos;em out, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="5380">I don&apos;t know. I couldn&apos;t see.</string>
  <string id="5381">Shadow.</string>
  <string id="5382">Again?</string>
  <string id="5385">So, this is the Blue Ridge Zone. </string>
  <string id="5386">We&apos;ve landed in Station Square. That means that the back door to Metropolis is to the north.</string>
  <string id="5387">Keep an eye out, team. I bet the Marauders won&apos;t be too happy to see us so close to their base!</string>
  <string id="5391">Eggman and I have some work to do on the Tornado, but it shouldn&apos;t take long. </string>
  <string id="5392">Just go out and activate the Tornado when you&apos;re ready to go. We should be done by then.</string>
  <string id="5411">Then get to it!</string>
  <string id="5418">You... You&apos;ve been practicing.</string>
  <string id="5420">Have you been working for the Marauders? </string>
  <string id="5426">The Marauders? Why would I work for them? I&apos;ve been searching for E-123 Omega. </string>
  <string id="5428">But ever since I got here, these Marauders have been coming out of nowhere to stop me. </string>
  <string id="5430">I&apos;ve decided to give any Marauders I find a severe beating. To put it mildly.</string>
  <string id="5431">Looks that way.</string>
  <string id="5432">I will join you for now. Strength in numbers, right? </string>
  <string id="5433">Keep your friends close....</string>
  <string id="5434">Exactly. </string>
  <string id="5435">Omega should be in Metropolis. If we make it inside, I&apos;d like to look for him.</string>
  <string id="5436">Let&apos;s go. Clock&apos;s ticking.</string>
  <string id="5437">And here. Take this. I hoped it would lead me to Omega, but as far as I can tell, it&apos;s just a hunk of junk.</string>
  <string id="5438">It looks like another Eggman device!</string>
  <string id="5444">E-123 Omega is one of Eggman&apos;s most powerful robots. Unlike Eggman&apos;s other robots, however, Omega was... intelligent. He hated Eggman.</string>
  <string id="5445">That is how I remember it, yes.</string>
  <string id="5446">Omega was trying to track down Eggman . I&apos;ve searched all of Eggman&apos;s old hideouts for Omega, but no luck.</string>
  <string id="5447">I think maybe Omega went into Metropolis and he got disabled somehow. I was on my way to find him when you stopped me.</string>
  <string id="5449">Because a powerful and friendly Eggman robot is a valuable ally. Even the likes of you should understand that.</string>
  <string id="5450">More than that, though, he was my friend. And I won&apos;t let a friend rust in Metropolis at the hands of those Marauders.</string>
  <string id="5451">Is that so? I find it strange you stooped to working with Eggman if things are going so well for you.</string>
  <string id="5452">Oh, my poor creature. Can&apos;t you see I&apos;ve reformed?</string>
  <string id="5454">Arguing won&apos;t get us anywhere.</string>
  <string id="5455">I agree.</string>
  <string id="5456">He&apos;s getting away! You&apos;re the only one who can catch him, Sonic. Go!</string>
  <string id="5457">You can&apos;t outrun me, Shadow!</string>
  <string id="5458">Maybe not. But I can outfight you!</string>
  <string id="5461">Tell me why you&apos;re out here, Shadow. Now.</string>
  <string id="5473">Join us, Shadow. We have a common enemy.</string>
  <string id="5486">What happened to Omega?</string>
  <string id="5490">It sure didn&apos;t take much to stop you.</string>
  <string id="5492">Why were you looking for him?</string>
  <string id="5494">Seems to me your rescue wasn&apos;t going so well.</string>
  <string id="5495">Seems like the only one getting beaten around here is you.</string>
  <string id="5505">Stop them, team!</string>
  <string id="5506">She&apos;s an echidna!</string>
  <string id="5509">Aha! The tunnel! Just as I left it!</string>
  <string id="5510">Won&apos;t the Marauders know about these tunnels?</string>
  <string id="5511">Ha! Silly girl. You know nothing of the sublime art of infiltration.</string>
  <string id="5512">Once we enter these tunnels, we will be in the Metropolis underground. From there, we mount our assault. </string>
  <string id="5513">Sounds dangerous.</string>
  <string id="5514">Sounds stupid.</string>
  <string id="5515">Sounds like our only way in.</string>
  <string id="5517">That&apos;s right, Sonic. The great Dr. Robotnik has reformed! Ha ha ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="5518">Likely story, Eggman!</string>
  <string id="5519">Not so fast, Amy. He might be telling the truth.</string>
  <string id="5521">You can&apos;t be serious!</string>
  <string id="5522">Thank you, Sonic the Hedgehog.</string>
  <string id="5527">I have charted the flight path of your Angel Island. And with equipment no more advanced than a rusty garbage can lid. </string>
  <string id="5528">According to my projections, Angel Island is being pulled to Metropolis, where the Marauders are based!</string>
  <string id="5529">The Marauders must have polarized the Emeralds to attract the Master Emerald, essentially towing Angel Island right to them!</string>
  <string id="5531">If you can get into Metropolis, you can stop the Marauders and reach Angel Island at the same time. </string>
  <string id="5532">But Metropolis is almost impossible to get into, even when it isn&apos;t completely ruined!</string>
  <string id="5533">Ah! Of course, I have anticipated this! I have a plan to get inside the city!</string>
  <string id="5534">We must travel to the Blue Ridge Zone and work our way to the edge of Metropolis. </string>
  <string id="5535">From there, I can get you into the city, and you can bring down the Marauders from inside. </string>
  <string id="5536">One problem: The Tornado isn&apos;t quite ready yet. I don&apos;t think she&apos;ll fly us all the way to Blue Ridge!</string>
  <string id="5537">Then we shall work together. With my help, your little airplane will be able to reach the ends of the world!</string>
  <string id="5538">The Tornado should be ready by the time you&apos;re ready to go, Sonic. Just go outside and activate the Tornado when you&apos;re ready!</string>
  <string id="5539">Yes! Let the heroism commence!</string>
  <string id="5540">How quickly you forget!</string>
  <string id="5541">Metropolis was my most heavily fortified fortress! Laser turrets! Deadly robots! Acid traps!</string>
  <string id="5542">Oh, it was beautiful!</string>
  <string id="5543">Most of that was destroyed after our last battle. But the Marauders have been rebuilding.</string>
  <string id="5544">It may be more dangerous now than when I was in charge, if you can believe that!</string>
  <string id="5545">Oh, a glorious tale! Ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="5547">I almost didn&apos;t make it out! But in my incalculable brilliance, I had anticipated my own defeat!</string>
  <string id="5548">I managed to call a life-support robot, which I had designed just for this purpose, to my side. </string>
  <string id="5549">The robot rescued me from the wreckage, dragged me to safety, and nursed me back to health. </string>
  <string id="5550">That sounds awfully convenient.</string>
  <string id="5551">Since then, I have worked to cobble these defenses and machines from mere scraps, unworthy of my genius.</string>
  <string id="5552"> Only one of my stupendous intelligence could build such machines from nothing!</string>
  <string id="5553">We might not have a choice! If anyone can get us into Metropolis, it&apos;s him!</string>
  <string id="5554">I hate the idea, too, but I think Eggman&apos;s right.</string>
  <string id="5555">It&apos;s about time Eggman helped out. Let&apos;s just keep an eye on him.</string>
  <string id="5556">Aw, he&apos;s not so bad, just funny-lookin&apos;! We should give him a chance!</string>
  <string id="5557">What&apos;s the worst that can happen? If he starts being evil again, just spank him again like you did last time.</string>
  <string id="5558">*sniff* *sniff* I think there&apos;s a bug in my nose.</string>
  <string id="5559">Listen to them, my blue friend. You need me. </string>
  <string id="5560">With your speed and courage and my unparalleled, superior genius....</string>
  <string id="5561">I have been tracking the Marauders for some time, ever since they tripped a sensor in one of my old hideouts.</string>
  <string id="5562">So desperate are they that they use my old, cast-off bases as headquarters! They&apos;ve even reprogrammed my obsolete-model robots to do their bidding!</string>
  <string id="5563">The sheer nerve of it all! The least they could do was ask!</string>
  <string id="5564">Ha! But I have the last laugh! So durable is my machinery that I was able to watch them as they worked. </string>
  <string id="5565">I have yet to see a Chaos Emerald with them, but I did see one of their viewscreens. On it were the letters &quot;IX.&quot;</string>
  <string id="5566">Well. And here I thought you might have found patience on your little sabbatical.</string>
  <string id="5567">Why... yes! The Roman numeral nine. Yes. That occurred to me long ago, of course.</string>
  <string id="5568">Well, obviously, it means... &quot;IX.&quot; Don&apos;t you see?! Ha ha ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="5569">Why not? These Marauders have the Chaos Emeralds. They&apos;re as much a threat to me as they are to you!</string>
  <string id="5570">I know how much trouble you&apos;d be in if I had them right now. Oh, the glorious carnage I could cause! Ha ha ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="5571">The robots we&apos;ve seen so far have been old models, Sonic. Eggman&apos;s too proud to rely on old machines.</string>
  <string id="5573">Hm. There&apos;s something to that. My captors were way too skilled and capable to be Eggman&apos;s minions.</string>
  <string id="5574">Hey!!</string>
  <string id="5587">We don&apos;t have time to argue. Let&apos;s hear him out.</string>
  <string id="5599">Skip the boasting and tell us your plan. </string>
  <string id="5606">Why is it so difficult to get into Metropolis?</string>
  <string id="5611">How did you escape our last battle, Eggman?</string>
  <string id="5619">I can&apos;t! I won&apos;t work with Eggman!</string>
  <string id="5627">Tell us what you know, Eggman. All of it.</string>
  <string id="5632">Stop blathering and get to the point. </string>
  <string id="5634">&quot;IX&quot;? As in &quot;nine&quot;?</string>
  <string id="5635">What does that mean?</string>
  <string id="5636">Why should we trust you?</string>
  <string id="5642">Then let&apos;s talk, Eggman. And skip the boring details.</string>
  <string id="5645">Oh, Sonic. I wanted to talk to you.</string>
  <string id="5646">I don&apos;t know how to say this, so I&apos;ll just come out with it: You&apos;ve been really nice to me lately.</string>
  <string id="5651">Whew! That was tough!</string>
  <string id="5652">Yes. They don&apos;t make &apos;em how I used to.</string>
  <string id="5653">Let&apos;s get this cannon working and clear the skies for Sonic!</string>
  <string id="5655">What&apos;s that noise? Sounds like... airships above? </string>
  <string id="5656">Tails! This is Sonic! The Marauders are taking off! </string>
  <string id="5657">We&apos;re on one of the airships, on our way to Angel Island.</string>
  <string id="5658">It should be safe for you to leave the underground now.</string>
  <string id="5659">Thanks, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="5660">Be careful! Sonic out!</string>
  <string id="5661">That&apos;s our cue!</string>
  <string id="5662">After you, my furry friend.</string>
  <string id="5663">Are you sure this is the right way?</string>
  <string id="5664">If you insist!</string>
  <string id="5665">I hid a device in these tunnels. We&apos;ll need it to build a weapon against those Marauders.</string>
  <string id="5666">Then lead on, Eggman.</string>
  <string id="5667">Good. We have our teams. So what&apos;s the plan?</string>
  <string id="5668">Sonic and I will take our team up into Metropolis and see what we can find out.</string>
  <string id="5669">We&apos;ll wipe out any Marauders we see and try to stop them before they get to Angel Island.</string>
  <string id="5670">Eggman and I will take our team to Eggman&apos;s weapons lab. </string>
  <string id="5671">We&apos;ll put together a weapon we can use to even the odds against the Marauders!</string>
  <string id="5672">I bet the Marauders are everywhere up there.</string>
  <string id="5673">Do not fear! In my infinite wisdom, I crafted a system of tunnels beneath the city!</string>
  <string id="5674">We can use them to travel unnoticed! Brilliant!</string>
  <string id="5675">That sounds like a plan!</string>
  <string id="5677">Once we think the surface is safe, we&apos;ll radio and let you know.</string>
  <string id="5678">This will be dangerous, everyone. Please be careful!</string>
  <string id="5679">Good luck, team!</string>
  <string id="5680">And be careful!</string>
  <string id="5681">Hello, Sonic. Is everyone ready to go?</string>
  <string id="5682">Okay!</string>
  <string id="5683">Everyone, gather around!</string>
  <string id="5684">We have a plan? </string>
  <string id="5685">We do! But it won&apos;t be easy.</string>
  <string id="5686">My calculations say that Angel Island will be directly over Metropolis in a matter of moments. </string>
  <string id="5687">If you want to save your Master Emerald, you&apos;ll have to hurry. My calculations never lie.</string>
  <string id="5688">It sounded like Shade didn&apos;t have the Master Emerald yet. If she did, this place would be swarming with Nocturnus Clan echidnas.</string>
  <string id="5690">But there&apos;s already a whole army of Marauders and robots! Even Sonic can&apos;t take on an army without backup!</string>
  <string id="5691">I, of course, anticipated this event. I have, in my advanced weaponry lab, the perfect machine for the job. </string>
  <string id="5692">Given time, I and my powerful scientific mind could rig up a weapon to help against our foes.</string>
  <string id="5693">We will be unstoppable! Ha ha ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="5694">Metropolis is crawling with bad guys, though. You&apos;d never get there by yourself. </string>
  <string id="5695">Go with him, then. I&apos;ll go to Angel Island alone.</string>
  <string id="5696">Right!</string>
  <string id="5697">I&apos;ll go with Eggman. Maybe I can help him with the weapon!</string>
  <string id="5699">I can do this alone.</string>
  <string id="5701">What about the rest of us? </string>
  <string id="5702">We&apos;ll divide into two teams, like this: </string>
  <string id="5704">What else do we need to know? It&apos;s my job to protect the Master Emerald, whatever the cost. </string>
  <string id="5705">The Nocturnus Clan must have some way of getting onto Angel Island. </string>
  <string id="5706">I&apos;ll stop them before they get there, or I&apos;ll hitch a ride and stop them on the island.</string>
  <string id="5707">You still don&apos;t trust me, Sonic? Why, I&apos;m hurt. Ha ha ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="5708">We have a common enemy, my blue friend. And even if we didn&apos;t, I&apos;ve given up, remember?</string>
  <string id="5709">You&apos;ve won, Sonic! The great Doctor Eggman is no longer a threat!</string>
  <string id="5710">Good. Then he won&apos;t get in my way. </string>
  <string id="5711">Protecting the Chaos Emeralds is my responsibility. Mine alone.</string>
  <string id="5712">I am the last of the echidnas, charged with the--</string>
  <string id="5714">I....</string>
  <string id="5716">All right, Sonic. But stay out of my way.</string>
  <string id="5717">Come let me know when you are. We almost have a plan figured out.</string>
  <string id="5742">We&apos;ll use these communicators to keep in touch.</string>
  <string id="5747">Yes. Let&apos;s get moving.</string>
  <string id="5756">Hi, I&apos;m Sonic. Have we met?</string>
  <string id="5761">I say we split up. We can do both.</string>
  <string id="5763">I&apos;ll go with Knuckles. </string>
  <string id="5765">I&apos;m not doubting you. But I want a piece of that Shade, too.</string>
  <string id="5770">What else do we know about the situation?</string>
  <string id="5773">How do we know Eggman won&apos;t just turn on us?</string>
  <string id="5777">Let&apos;s split up into two teams.</string>
  <string id="5778">Knuckles, you don&apos;t have to defend Angel Island alone!</string>
  <string id="5780">You&apos;re not the last anymore, Knuckles.</string>
  <string id="5784">No, not quite.</string>
  <string id="5787">We can&apos;t hold out here much longer, Sonic. </string>
  <string id="5788">We&apos;ll hold out as long as it takes!</string>
  <string id="5790">Valiant effort, dustlings. But I can see you&apos;re wearing down. </string>
  <string id="5791">I must say, I am impressed. Never before has a civilization failed to kneel before me. </string>
  <string id="5792">It won&apos;t be a complete waste to destroy you myself. </string>
  <string id="5793">Come, my Nocturnus! To me!</string>
  <string id="5795">We&apos;re not ready for this, Sonic....</string>
  <string id="5796">We have to be.</string>
  <string id="5798">Sonic!</string>
  <string id="5799">Tails! Just in time!</string>
  <string id="5800">More dust to sweep away. Very well, then. Let us see what you&apos;ve got.</string>
  <string id="5802">Start shaking, Ix. Now you&apos;ve got our full attention.</string>
  <string id="5810">We&apos;re going to need help on this one.</string>
  <string id="5812">Copy that! Tails out!</string>
  <string id="5813">Well, let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="5814">What are you doing?! We&apos;ll be killed!</string>
  <string id="5815">Maybe we can&apos;t beat them by ourselves, but we can definitely slow them down until Tails gets here.</string>
  <string id="5822">No!</string>
  <string id="5823">We&apos;ll never make it past the fleet without our main weapon!</string>
  <string id="5824">I have an idea.</string>
  <string id="5825">Tails! Come in, Tails!</string>
  <string id="5826">Tails here.</string>
  <string id="5827">Our main weapon is down! There&apos;s no way we can get past the Marauder fleet! We need ground support!</string>
  <string id="5828">Hang on, Sonic! We&apos;ll find a way to help!</string>
  <string id="5829">Hurry!</string>
  <string id="5830">There. The airship is ours. </string>
  <string id="5831">Let&apos;s go get those Marauder losers!</string>
  <string id="5832">Let&apos;s not celebrate yet. I think the captain hit some sort of alarm. The whole fleet knows we took this ship.</string>
  <string id="5833">Did you figure that out yourself? Or was that huge boarding party your big clue?</string>
  <string id="5834">We have to defeat those boarding parties before they bring the ship down!</string>
  <string id="5835">This is going to be fun!</string>
  <string id="5836">We&apos;ve taken off. Now we just need to take control.</string>
  <string id="5837">It shouldn&apos;t be hard to get to the bridge and take out the captain. Then we can fly this thing ourselves. </string>
  <string id="5838">Sounds like a plan.</string>
  <string id="5839">Tails calling Sonic! Come in, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="5840">I&apos;m here, Tails.</string>
  <string id="5841">We&apos;ve got the parts and are building the weapon. </string>
  <string id="5842">Good. We&apos;re in the air now. </string>
  <string id="5843">Yay! Good luck, team! Tails out!</string>
  <string id="5844">He&apos;s so cheerful.</string>
  <string id="5845">Let&apos;s make sure he can stay that way.</string>
  <string id="5847">They&apos;re taking off!</string>
  <string id="5848">Quick! We might be able to catch that last one.</string>
  <string id="5849">Hurry!</string>
  <string id="5850">The airbase!</string>
  <string id="5851">Let&apos;s go inside! Hurry!</string>
  <string id="5852">Look, Sonic. It looks like airships are taking off from that airbase.</string>
  <string id="5853">We&apos;re too late. </string>
  <string id="5854">No, we&apos;re not. If we can stow away on one of the airships, we can get to Angel Island just as they do.</string>
  <string id="5855">If we&apos;re fast enough, that just might work. </string>
  <string id="5856">Fast enough? Did you forget who I am?</string>
  <string id="5857">Wow. We really did a number on this place.</string>
  <string id="5858">See anything?</string>
  <string id="5859">Let me... Oh.</string>
  <string id="5860">What is it?</string>
  <string id="5861">Angel Island. I see it. If Eggman is correct, it will be in place soon. </string>
  <string id="5862">Then let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="5868">This looks like the way out. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="5869">These tunnels look familiar.</string>
  <string id="5870">We&apos;ve been through here before, I think. Last time we brought down Eggman.</string>
  <string id="5871">Listen. It sounds like we&apos;re not alone.</string>
  <string id="5872">Then let&apos;s change that.</string>
  <string id="5873">Don&apos;t worry, Sonic. I&apos;ll be ready when the time comes. </string>
  <string id="5874">Leave me alone, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="5875">Thanks. </string>
  <string id="5876">Don&apos;t worry. I&apos;ll be ready to fight when the time comes.</string>
  <string id="5877">I--I&apos;m fine. It&apos;s just....</string>
  <string id="5880">I thought I was the last echidna. All my people died out, and I was the only one left. </string>
  <string id="5881">But now, here comes Shade. She&apos;s an echidna! And the Nocturnus Clan Marauders. All echidnas!</string>
  <string id="5882">I finally meet more of my kind, and they&apos;re villains.</string>
  <string id="5884">I guess. Maybe she just wants to bring her people back. I know I would.</string>
  <string id="5885">No doubt about that. I am the guardian of the Master Emerald. It doesn&apos;t matter who they are. I will stop them.</string>
  <string id="5886">Not much. Though....</string>
  <string id="5887">There is an old legend in echidna history about an echidna race called the Nocturnus Clan.</string>
  <string id="5888">Long ago, the Nocturnus Clan ruled much of the known world, crushing everyone in its path.</string>
  <string id="5889">They were rivaled only by my ancestors, led by their chief, Pachacamac.</string>
  <string id="5890">But at the height of their power, the Nocturnus Clan disappeared. The whole civilization.</string>
  <string id="5891">No one knows where they went, or even if they survived.</string>
  <string id="5892">Maybe. I don&apos;t know. But Shade said something about returning to this world. </string>
  <string id="5893">It made me think. That&apos;s all. </string>
  <string id="5981">I can&apos;t have you moping around, Knuckles.</string>
  <string id="5984">Are you okay, Knuckles?</string>
  <string id="5991">I&apos;ll leave you alone now.</string>
  <string id="5992">Maybe they&apos;re not so bad.</string>
  <string id="5993">If we meet them again, we will have to stop them.</string>
  <string id="5994">Do you know anything about this &quot;Shade&quot; person?</string>
  <string id="6000">I see. I&apos;ll leave you alone now. </string>
  <string id="6001">And you think they&apos;re coming back?</string>
  <string id="6003">Is that what&apos;s bothering you?</string>
  <string id="6004">Such adventure! I begin to see why you and Sonic do all this running and jumping and falling off things!</string>
  <string id="6005">Ha ha ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="6006">Oh, come now. Angel Island isn&apos;t going anywhere! At least, not anymore!</string>
  <string id="6010">Here we go!</string>
  <string id="6012">Oh, yes, I know. Saving the world this and fighting evil that. </string>
  <string id="6013">It&apos;s all an excuse to run about and hop on things, is it not? </string>
  <string id="6014">Ha! I&apos;m sure it is! The secret of this so-called &quot;heroism&quot; is mine! Ha ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="6015">And stop me you did!</string>
  <string id="6016">It&apos;s thrilling and full of adventure! And it&apos;s rollicking good exercise! Ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="6017">Sonic got himself into trouble again, did he?</string>
  <string id="6018">Yes. Come, let us return to the underground. There I will repair the teleporter and send us all straight to Angel Island!</string>
  <string id="6019">Ha ha ha! Again my genius overcomes all!</string>
  <string id="6020">Surely you considered that we could repair the teleporter in the underground and use it to travel to Angel Island.</string>
  <string id="6021">That couldn&apos;t possibly have slipped your mind, could it, Tails?</string>
  <string id="6022">I... er... I was busy!</string>
  <string id="6023">Yes, I see!</string>
  <string id="6024">We must return to the underground. There I will repair my transporter and send us all straight up to Angel Island!</string>
  <string id="6025">Great! Let&apos;s go. Sonic needs us!</string>
  <string id="6026">Surely you considered that we could use the tele-- Ah, yes. </string>
  <string id="6027">Again you surprise me, my furry friend. Clearly my genius is rubbing off!</string>
  <string id="6028">My lovely cannon! You&apos;re alive!</string>
  <string id="6029">We have to hurry!</string>
  <string id="6030">Wait... I seem to remember something about....</string>
  <string id="6032">Ah, yes. I placed a guardian here to protect the cannon! I impress even myself!</string>
  <string id="6033">No time to disable the guardian! We have to fight it!</string>
  <string id="6034">Pity.</string>
  <string id="6035">There. That ought to do it.</string>
  <string id="6036">I have attached our Beam Cannon to this old sky hopper I found.</string>
  <string id="6037">Never before has the world seen such a mighty weapon! Ha ha ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="6038">Eggman, we have to help Sonic!</string>
  <string id="6039">What?!? Again?!?</string>
  <string id="6040">They can&apos;t get past the airship fleet. We need to sink those enemy ships from here!</string>
  <string id="6041">Yes. Well. As always, I know just the thing!</string>
  <string id="6042">Before you so rudely destroyed my city, I built a massive anti-aircraft cannon in the southern reaches of Metropolis.</string>
  <string id="6043">Of course, I never got a chance to use it, but I happen to know it&apos;s still there, and the Marauders have yet to discover it!</string>
  <string id="6044">Then we can use it to save Sonic!</string>
  <string id="6045">Yes. It isn&apos;t--what was it--&quot;non-lethal&quot;? But it will bring those ships down!</string>
  <string id="6046">South, you say? Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="6047">Ah! My old weapons lab!</string>
  <string id="6048">How I&apos;ve missed this place!</string>
  <string id="6049">Looks... ruined.</string>
  <string id="6050">*sniff* It pains my heart to see her this way....</string>
  <string id="6051">Let&apos;s get to work!</string>
  <string id="6052">Yes. Let&apos;s.</string>
  <string id="6053">Ah, yes! Lovely!</string>
  <string id="6054">Even I am impressed by my craftsmanship!</string>
  <string id="6055">What did you find?</string>
  <string id="6056">With these parts, I can assemble a Massive Blast Egg-Cannon the likes of which has never been seen before!</string>
  <string id="6057">A masterpiece of modern engineering! With this weapon, no one can withstand our might!</string>
  <string id="6058">I have a better idea!</string>
  <string id="6059">If we could somehow create a Beam Cannon that would teleport them back where they came from....</string>
  <string id="6060">We could send them home--wherever that is--without hurting them?</string>
  <string id="6061">Right!</string>
  <string id="6062">But they will suffer no injuries? Not even a little?!</string>
  <string id="6063">You can do it, Eggman! Just try!</string>
  <string id="6064">Not even a little tiny bit?</string>
  <string id="6065">On our team, we avoid violence when we can, Eggman. </string>
  <string id="6066">I see. Well, if your wacko &quot;pain-free&quot; machine works, I&apos;ll be very impressed.</string>
  <string id="6067">My weapons lab is to the south.</string>
  <string id="6068">Then let&apos;s get to work!</string>
  <string id="6069">My city!</string>
  <string id="6070">What have they done to... Argh!</string>
  <string id="6071">Those Marauder fools! Don&apos;t they know they&apos;ve invited the wrath of Doctor Eggman?!</string>
  <string id="6072">Oh, they&apos;re in trouble now.</string>
  <string id="6073">Quiet, girl!</string>
  <string id="6074">We have to find that part and get to the lab.</string>
  <string id="6075">There! The ionic defragulator!</string>
  <string id="6076">What does that do, exactly?</string>
  <string id="6079">By itself, it is nothing. But coupled with my hypersonic compactor rod--and my own stupendous intellect--it&apos;s a weapon!</string>
  <string id="6081">Come! The hypersonic compactor rod must be on the surface. Shall we go find it?</string>
  <string id="6082">No! We have to wait for Sonic&apos;s signal. </string>
  <string id="6083">I just hope they&apos;re all right. </string>
  <string id="6086">Welcome, my flabbergasted friends, to the Metropolis Underground!</string>
  <string id="6087">Wow. </string>
  <string id="6088">I have to hand it to you, Eggman, you really saved us this time.</string>
  <string id="6089">Please. Don&apos;t remind me.</string>
  <string id="6090">There&apos;s no time to lose! We need a plan!</string>
  <string id="6091">We can rest here for a moment. My awesome fortifications ensure we&apos;ll have warning if the echidnas should come looking for us.</string>
  <string id="6092">Don&apos;t mind the teleporter over there. It hasn&apos;t worked for ages.</string>
  <string id="6093">Great. Everyone rest for a bit, and we&apos;ll come up with a plan when we&apos;re ready.</string>
  <string id="6094">Sonic, you might want to talk to Knuckles. He looks... unhappy.</string>
  <string id="6095">Come talk to me when you&apos;re ready to get moving.</string>
  <string id="6097">Quick! We have to get to Angel Island!</string>
  <string id="6104">It&apos;s not just for the fun of it, Eggman!</string>
  <string id="6107">We did it because we had to stop you!</string>
  <string id="6109">No time to talk. We have to help Sonic!</string>
  <string id="6111">There&apos;s no way we can get up there in time!</string>
  <string id="6119">If we could use the teleporter in the underground....</string>
  <string id="6188">Sure. I bet he has a lot on his mind.</string>
  <string id="6195">Oh no you don&apos;t! You stay away from him, witch!</string>
  <string id="6196">Please. I wish to be of use. </string>
  <string id="6200">With a little work, we could use the tracker I made to lock onto whatever signal we choose!</string>
  <string id="6201">We could fire it anywhere, but it would only hit what we tell it to hit!</string>
  <string id="6202">I hadn&apos;t thought of that. That&apos;s genius! Anywhere in the world, eh?</string>
  <string id="6203">We could take out the Marauders without hitting our friends!</string>
  <string id="6210">Whew. That was quite a welcome!</string>
  <string id="6211">We need to find the Chaos Emerald. Let&apos;s look around. </string>
  <string id="6212">And be on the lookout for more of these Kron!</string>
  <string id="6213">We did it! We&apos;re in the Twilight Cage!</string>
  <string id="6214">I&apos;ve never heard anyone sound so happy to be here.</string>
  <string id="6215">We won&apos;t be here long, Shade. Not if I have anything to say about it. </string>
  <string id="6217">Switching to manual navigation. Grab hold, team. This could get rough.</string>
  <string id="6218">What&apos;s going on?</string>
  <string id="6219">Something&apos;s wrong. We didn&apos;t take into account the trans-spatial frequency. It&apos;s jamming our Dimensional Buffer!</string>
  <string id="6220">Pretend I have no idea what you&apos;re talking about, cutie. Because I don&apos;t.</string>
  <string id="6221">Stuff is happening, and we&apos;re losing power.</string>
  <string id="6223">I&apos;ll try to set down on that planetoid there, but it&apos;s going to be a hard landing!</string>
  <string id="6225">*pant* *pant*</string>
  <string id="6226">Is everyone all right? </string>
  <string id="6227">I think so.</string>
  <string id="6228">I&apos;m fine.</string>
  <string id="6229">I think my eyes are broken. No, wait. They&apos;re just closed.</string>
  <string id="6230">Let&apos;s get out and look around.</string>
  <string id="6252">Technology overcomes all obstacles. Our warp belts create bubbles of space around us. Within that bubble, it&apos;s as if we never left the Twilight Cage.</string>
  <string id="6253">Unfortunately, it isn&apos;t perfect. Eventually the warp bubbles wear off, and we must return. </string>
  <string id="6254">To truly cross into this world, Ix needed to open the wormhole. And to do that, he needed the Master Emerald.</string>
  <string id="6255">Yes. We must.</string>
  <string id="6256">Your military had set up around the base of the island. To conquer Angel Island, Ix needed to bring it to him. </string>
  <string id="6257">He used the Chaos Emeralds to draw the island over Metropolis, where we had set up our base.</string>
  <string id="6258">The plan was to assault the island on our turf, rather than attacking it with legions of soldiers underneath.</string>
  <string id="6259">Why should we believe anything Shade says?</string>
  <string id="6260">But you and your people got here without the Master Emerald.</string>
  <string id="6263">We have to find a way to stop him.</string>
  <string id="6265">What about these &quot;legends&quot; you spoke about?</string>
  <string id="6266">Why did he need the other Chaos Emeralds?</string>
  <string id="6267">Why did he move Angel Island?</string>
  <string id="6270">How did the Marauders get here without the Master Emerald?</string>
  <string id="6271">We&apos;re not taking chances. We&apos;ve posted soldiers in Mystic Ruins to watch over Angel Island.</string>
  <string id="6272">Vector the Crocodile and Team Chaotix have volunteered to scout for further clues. They&apos;re on the channel now.</string>
  <string id="6273">Yo, Sonic. It&apos;s about time you came back.</string>
  <string id="6275">They have been instrumental in pinning down these four locations. Now it&apos;s up to you to explore them for signs of Knuckles.</string>
  <string id="6283">And perhaps you can use my warp belt to put together a new Dimensional Buffer.</string>
  <string id="6284">I could, at that. And my instruments detect that there might be a Chaos Emerald here on this planetoid!</string>
  <string id="6285">It would, yes. But I don&apos;t deserve to live on your world. Not if I led a tyrant there to destroy it. </string>
  <string id="6286">I-- I&apos;d be humbled if you&apos;d bring me back with you. I, who led Lord Ix to your world. </string>
  <string id="6287">I can probably work the Dimensional Buffer to allow her through. I&apos;ll check it out!</string>
  <string id="6288">My people use warp belts to cross dimensions. The belts create a bubble of Twilight space around us.</string>
  <string id="6289">Like an astronaut in a space suit?</string>
  <string id="6290">I believe so, yes.</string>
  <string id="6292">Wouldn&apos;t that leave you stranded here, Shade?</string>
  <string id="6293">Maybe she can come back with us through the wormhole.</string>
  <string id="6295">What exactly is a warp belt?</string>
  <string id="6298">Let&apos;s go get that Chaos Emerald!</string>
  <string id="6299">I don&apos;t see any GUN soldiers here. Looks like the coast is clear.</string>
  <string id="6301">Yup, I was just fishing over there with Froggy. There was a bunch of guys in uniforms around but they weren&apos;t scaring the fish.</string>
  <string id="6302">All of a sudden, we heard all this noise and saw all these flashy lights! I looked over and saw the soldiers running, and the sneezy fog rolled in!</string>
  <string id="6303">This &quot;fog&quot; is actually some kind of gas. Someone must have used the gas to chase away the GUN soldiers!</string>
  <string id="6309">Sorry, Sonic. We can&apos;t let you through here. It&apos;s too dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6310">I think I have an idea, Sonic. </string>
  <string id="6311">There&apos;s an airfield on the other side of Mystic Ruins. Maybe we can get in from there.</string>
  <string id="6312">Wait... you mean...?</string>
  <string id="6313">Yes. Let&apos;s get back to the workshop, team.</string>
  <string id="6314">We&apos;ll take the Tornado!</string>
  <string id="6315">And our orders are to keep everyone out until the situation is normalized. That includes you, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="6316">We have a division there on high alert to defend Angel island from the Marauders. No one in or out, I&apos;m sorry.</string>
  <string id="6317">Then we&apos;ll find a way around you.</string>
  <string id="6323">We have to get through here to find Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="6324">Why is it too dangerous?</string>
  <string id="6326">Sorry, Sonic. We can&apos;t let you through here. Commander&apos;s orders. </string>
  <string id="6327">Perfect Chaos was Pachacamac&apos;s doing. Your clan paid the price for unleashing its anger, but my clan was spared.</string>
  <string id="6328">With our greatest rivals gone, the Nocturnus Clan nearly colonized the rest of the world. Then we were exiled to the Twilight Cage.</string>
  <string id="6329">Wait... Shade is 4000 years old?</string>
  <string id="6330">You always were into older women, eh, Knuckles?</string>
  <string id="6339">Was that... a Gizoid?</string>
  <string id="6341">I have a bad feeling about this.</string>
  <string id="6347">If Ix values this factory so much, I can&apos;t wait to take it from him!</string>
  <string id="6355">Halt you! State you your business with the mighty Foreman of the Kron!</string>
  <string id="6356">Fought we have many Nocturnus. Not Nocturnus are you.</string>
  <string id="6357">Well. Shade is, but....</string>
  <string id="6358">Small creatures with fur. Look you like Nocturnus. If not you Nocturnus, then must be you Sonic the Hedgehog.</string>
  <string id="6359">Wish we to live peacefully upon this ground. But forced we were for Lord Ix to build weapons and ships.</string>
  <string id="6360">Enslaved us did Lord Ix. Stole he our precious ore.</string>
  <string id="6361">Angry became we. Decided we to fight.</string>
  <string id="6364">Help us you against Lord Ix? Mad gone you. Mad gone.</string>
  <string id="6365">We&apos;re here to defeat Ix. If we can help you, maybe Ix will be weaker!</string>
  <string id="6366">Then speak you with Foreman Krag. Go you now, before change mind I do.</string>
  <string id="6367">Go you through doors to the west. Follow you to Foreman Krag.</string>
  <string id="6368">Beware you my fellow Kron. See you as Nocturnus spies will they still.</string>
  <string id="6369">Crystal here. Brought here to power factory for weapons of war.</string>
  <string id="6370">Never saw did Foreman Krag this crystal. But heard of it has he.</string>
  <string id="6371">Maybe their foreman knows where it is? Or how to get it back? </string>
  <string id="6372">Allies! Never allies we were to Ix! Always slaves we were! Only now realized this did Foreman Krag.</string>
  <string id="6373">Realized too late city to save. Too late war to win.</string>
  <string id="6374">They attacked us because they thought we were Nocturnus! They obviously don&apos;t like the Nocturnus Clan around here. </string>
  <string id="6375">This is very strange. Last I knew, the Kron served Lord Ix.</string>
  <string id="6376">Speak we strangely? Perhaps listen you not so good.</string>
  <string id="6378">Halt, Nocturnus! Defile you shall not this ancient ground!</string>
  <string id="6379">Nocturnus?!</string>
  <string id="6380">They think we&apos;re Nocturnus! Why would they attack us? Could they be against the Nocturnus?</string>
  <string id="6381">This is certainly strange.</string>
  <string id="6382">Miss did you my meaning? Nocturnus goons, die you now!</string>
  <string id="6383">We&apos;re here to help you against the Nocturnus.</string>
  <string id="6384">We&apos;re here to speak with him about the Chaos Emerald.</string>
  <string id="6393">Maybe we can help each other against Ix.</string>
  <string id="6399">Do you know anything about the Chaos Emeralds?</string>
  <string id="6402">Why would Ix enslave his own allies?</string>
  <string id="6404">We&apos;re not here to fight you. </string>
  <string id="6405">I don&apos;t know. Why don&apos;t you tell me, Tails?</string>
  <string id="6408">Why do you speak so strangely?</string>
  <string id="6416">That did it! The forcefield should be down!</string>
  <string id="6418">What&apos;s that noise?</string>
  <string id="6419">The Kron must be through! We did it!</string>
  <string id="6420">That must be the generator! Let&apos;s shut it down!</string>
  <string id="6421">We&apos;re in! Now to find the generator and shut it down!</string>
  <string id="6429">Great job, Sonic! Now let&apos;s get to the factory!</string>
  <string id="6444">Return you have. State you your business!</string>
  <string id="6445">Look you like the Nocturnus. Thought I taller the great Sonic Hedgehog be.</string>
  <string id="6446">But let I the Foreman decide. Inside go you.</string>
  <string id="6447">Wow! The leader of an alien race! This is exciting!</string>
  <string id="6448">Let&apos;s go on inside. I can&apos;t wait to meet this Foreman Krag!</string>
  <string id="6449">This could be a trap.</string>
  <string id="6450">Right. Let&apos;s be careful in there, team.</string>
  <string id="6451">Is it weird that I&apos;m starting to understand them?</string>
  <string id="6452">Think I it is... er... now they have me doing it!</string>
  <string id="6453">I like these people! I wonder if they have pie!</string>
  <string id="6454">Yeah. Rock pie. With rocks.</string>
  <string id="6455">Lost the crystal was. Speak more of it the Foreman will.</string>
  <string id="6456">Inside go you. Disrespect you not the Foreman.</string>
  <string id="6475">Brrrrm. Return do you. Not completed task have you.</string>
  <string id="6476">Go you. From the Nocturnus free us.</string>
  <string id="6477">Brrm. Come you closer. Let see you the mighty Foreman Krag.</string>
  <string id="6478">Mmmm. Yes. Heard of you I have. Wanted enemy Sonic the Hedgehog. Demanded has Lord Ix your capture.</string>
  <string id="6479">Capture Ix did our factory. Built we their tools, armor, and weapons unmatched in all the worlds.</string>
  <string id="6480">Suffer we without factory. Suffer must Nocturnus for taking it. But blocked are we; build Ix did a forcefield to keep us out from factory. </string>
  <string id="6481">Exists a loading platform beneath factory. Lowers a crane cargo there. Covers not does the forcefield there. Enter you there.</string>
  <string id="6482">Shut you down generator and bring down forcefield from inside. Then retake we will factory from outside... by force.</string>
  <string id="6483">Stand by will my soldiers. Ready to attack will they be. When fall does forcefield, meet you me in courtyard of factory.</string>
  <string id="6484">Wish I steady ground for you. Now go.</string>
  <string id="6485">Spans a conveyor arm from mine to factory. Reach you mine to west of here, and travel you along conveyor arm to factory.</string>
  <string id="6486">Use this does Nocturnus to enter factory. Too big and slow are Kron to enter this way.</string>
  <string id="6487">Care not I what happens to crystal once retaken is factory. Once shut down is generator, take you crystal and use you it as you wish.</string>
  <string id="6488">Brought did Lord Ix a crystal. Use it does he to power factory.</string>
  <string id="6489">Know nothing do I of it or its power. Care not I whether it stays or goes.</string>
  <string id="6490">Brmmm. Help us the Nocturnus to defeat, and keep do you the crystal. A gift consider it.</string>
  <string id="6491">Appeared in the Twilight Cage did Lord Ix. Brrm. Quickly expanded over all lands did he.</string>
  <string id="6492">Demanded did he that weapons of war we build. Weapons to conquer and enslave.</string>
  <string id="6493">Refused did we. And angered it did Lord Ix.</string>
  <string id="6494">Ruthless were we, once. Ruled did I with fists of iron over world of ore, rock, and mines. Until.</string>
  <string id="6495">Until taken were we from our world. Until came Lord Ix with soldiers and demands. Refused did I to follow Lord Ix&apos;s command. And conquered was I.</string>
  <string id="6496">Then learned I the gritty taste of servitude. And now... brrrm. And now, rule fairly do I. Meant not to be slaves, the Kron. </string>
  <string id="6498">Brrmmm. In ancient past, as reckon furred creatures. Taken were we just after conquered did we our world.</string>
  <string id="6499">Left were we to rot in cage filled with night, rot silently did we until came the Nocturnus. </string>
  <string id="6500">Right. We&apos;ll return once we&apos;re done.</string>
  <string id="6503">How can we help you against the Nocturnus?</string>
  <string id="6507">Then let&apos;s get to work, team!</string>
  <string id="6510">Do you know how we can get to the crane?</string>
  <string id="6512">You promise we can have the Chaos Emerald?</string>
  <string id="6513">Do you know anything about a Chaos Emerald?</string>
  <string id="6519">Why do you resist the Nocturnus?</string>
  <string id="6523">You were taken away from your world?</string>
  <string id="6525">Brrrm. Brought down was forcefield. Retaken factory we have.</string>
  <string id="6526">Take you the crystal. Guard it does the Nocturnus, deep inside factory.</string>
  <string id="6527">Go you. Guard do we factory from Nocturnus attack.</string>
  <string id="6528">Go you through this door to my right. Lead it will to rest of factory.</string>
  <string id="6529">Most certainly attack will they. Ruthless is Lord Ix. Ruthless and easily angered he.</string>
  <string id="6530">Saved you our factory. But declared we war against Nocturnus.</string>
  <string id="6531">Declared we war against Nocturnus long ago. Only latest battle is this.</string>
  <string id="6532">Strengthened we are, with factory recovered. Helped you us immensely today.</string>
  <string id="6533">Not warriors are Kron, but very strong. Fought we Nocturnus for very long. Learn we tricks to defeat them.</string>
  <string id="6536">Thanks, Foreman Krag. We won&apos;t be long!</string>
  <string id="6537">Do you think the Nocturnus will attack?</string>
  <string id="6539">The sooner we get the Emerald, the sooner we can help fight.</string>
  <string id="6540">Declared war? That wasn&apos;t our intention!</string>
  <string id="6542">Will your men be okay up here?</string>
  <string id="6543">Halt you. In conference is Foreman Krag. Not seeing visitors he.</string>
  <string id="6548">Is everyone ready to go?</string>
  <string id="6549">Right! All aboard!</string>
  <string id="6550">Right! Let&apos;s do it!</string>
  <string id="6551">That ought to do it. We&apos;re about ready to go!</string>
  <string id="6552">Wait you a moment, hero of Kron.</string>
  <string id="6554">Wish to thank you does Foreman Krag. Take you this as token of appreciation.</string>
  <string id="6555">Welcome we you to Kron anytime. Consider we you friend of the Kron.</string>
  <string id="6557">Wow. Friends with an alien race! Who would have thought?</string>
  <string id="6558">I think they&apos;re sweet.</string>
  <string id="6561">Sonic, when you&apos;re ready to go, just climb aboard the Cyclone. </string>
  <string id="6562">We got it! The Chaos Emerald!</string>
  <string id="6563">With this, I can definitely fix up the Cyclone&apos;s star drive!</string>
  <string id="6565">Let&apos;s go meet Foreman Krag in the courtyard!</string>
  <string id="6566">Yes, let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="6568">No, there&apos;s more here I want to do.</string>
  <string id="6585">Mrmmm. Nothing have I to sell you today.</string>
  <string id="6587">Go you now.</string>
  <string id="6590">Never mind!</string>
  <string id="6591">The Nocturnus will find out what happened here. They will send more patrols to find us.</string>
  <string id="6592">Let them come, we&apos;ll take care of them!</string>
  <string id="6595">And then what happened?</string>
  <string id="6596">Okay, team! We&apos;re ready to go!</string>
  <string id="6597">You&apos;ve heard of him?</string>
  <string id="6598">Posted Lord Ix rewards for your capture. Know of you do all Kron. </string>
  <string id="6602">I&apos;m picking up Chaos Emeralds from each of the &quot;planetoids&quot; in the area. Strange that none of these places is fully a planet; just fragments, really.</string>
  <string id="6603">The one in the middle is the Nocturne. That&apos;s Lord Ix&apos;s fortress. No one gets onto the Nocturne without Lord Ix&apos;s permission.</string>
  <string id="6604">Then we look somewhere else. Where else can we go?</string>
  <string id="6605">The other places are Sector Scylla and Sector Charyb. We&apos;ve detected Chaos Emeralds from both sectors... and both are staunch allies of Lord Ix.</string>
  <string id="6606">I don&apos;t like the sound of that.</string>
  <string id="6607">Sector Charyb has a psychic shield around it that protects it from invasion by the other colonies. There&apos;s no way we can land there.</string>
  <string id="6608">Sector Scylla is torn by war. The Zoah and the N&apos;rrgal have fought almost nonstop for centuries.</string>
  <string id="6609">The Zoah are a warlike race of giants, driven to invade and conquer. They have tried to conquer the N&apos;rrgal for ages.</string>
  <string id="6610">The N&apos;rrgal use their overwhelming numbers to keep the Zoah invaders at bay. Both races are hardened by battle and fiercely loyal to Lord Ix. </string>
  <string id="6611">Just choose where you want to go from the travel map!</string>
  <string id="6612">I can&apos;t wait to see what these aliens are like!</string>
  <string id="6614">Even the Nocturnus fear to visit Sector Charyb, for there live the psychic Voxai.</string>
  <string id="6615">The Voxai operate as one mind, each individual working as part of the greater whole. Even Nocturnus patrols have fallen under the control of the Voxai Overmind.</string>
  <string id="6616">There is little unrest in the Voxai colonies. But there is little free will, either.</string>
  <string id="6617">Ix has the Master Emerald, Sonic. There&apos;s no way we can defeat him if we don&apos;t have all seven Chaos Emeralds when we get there!</string>
  <string id="6618">Besides, Lord Ix knows you&apos;re coming. He put up a repulsor field and surrounded the Nocturne with starfighters. Even the Cyclone wouldn&apos;t make it through there. </string>
  <string id="6619">No. I am a realist. I&apos;m trained to recognize a lost cause and to avoid wasting energy fighting the inevitable.</string>
  <string id="6627">Tell me more about Sector Scylla.</string>
  <string id="6630">Let&apos;s get going. The Emeralds won&apos;t recover themselves.</string>
  <string id="6635">I want to know more about Sector Charyb.</string>
  <string id="6638">Why not go straight to the Nocturne?</string>
  <string id="6640">You still admire Ix, don&apos;t you?</string>
  <string id="6642">Gross.</string>
  <string id="6643">No. This is an alien world! Look! Ooze! And that green energy....</string>
  <string id="6644">Look out!</string>
  <string id="6646">They&apos;re... they&apos;re eating the Cyclone!</string>
  <string id="6647">No, but I think they&apos;ve absorbed its energy. I think we&apos;re trapped here. </string>
  <string id="6648">Should we stop them?</string>
  <string id="6649">They didn&apos;t attack us directly. Maybe it&apos;s safer not to bother them for now.</string>
  <string id="6650">Right!</string>
  <string id="6653">These are N&apos;rrgal drones. The N&apos;rrgal collect and absorb energy, so they&apos;re probably depowering your ship. But they won&apos;t attack unless you do.</string>
  <string id="6654">That&apos;s a wise choice. As long as you don&apos;t bother them, they won&apos;t bother you. </string>
  <string id="6655">But the N&apos;rrgal are not entirely peaceful. They&apos;ve been fighting the Zoah for a long time. Any physical contact will be seen as an attack.</string>
  <string id="6656">Right. So we stay out of their way. Got it.</string>
  <string id="6665">Let&apos;s stop them, team!</string>
  <string id="6668">Shade, what should we do?</string>
  <string id="6669">Then let&apos;s stop them, team!</string>
  <string id="6670">Let&apos;s leave them alone... for now.</string>
  <string id="6674">Innnvaderrrs!</string>
  <string id="6675">Nnno! Innnvaderrrs!</string>
  <string id="6676">Don&apos;t worry. Those are just drones. They won&apos;t fight.</string>
  <string id="6677">They might go alert the N&apos;rrgal warriors, though. You might want to stop them before they can get away.</string>
  <string id="6678">Flee! Innnvaderrrs!</string>
  <string id="6683">Innnvaderrrsss... </string>
  <string id="6685">Zoah spies? Ha!</string>
  <string id="6686">Yeah! This is Sonic the Hedgehog!</string>
  <string id="6687">Ahhh... Sssonnnic. Yes. You will mmmeet with the Queennn....</string>
  <string id="6688">Thennn you will face the full mmmight of the N&apos;rrgal, whommm even the mmmighty Zoah cannot conquerrr....</string>
  <string id="6689">I suggest you accept the Queennn&apos;s invitationnn....</string>
  <string id="6690">I don&apos;t think we have a choice! The N&apos;rrgal have drained our ship. It&apos;s possible we can&apos;t leave without the Queen&apos;s help!</string>
  <string id="6691">I don&apos;t know much about the N&apos;rrgal Queen, but I know enough. If she wanted us dead, we&apos;d be swarmed by N&apos;rrgal warriors by now.</string>
  <string id="6692">You ask nnno questionsss. The Queennn awaits....</string>
  <string id="6693">All in the Twilllight Cage knnnow Sonnnic. Yesss. The Queennn knowsss you....</string>
  <string id="6697">And if I say no?</string>
  <string id="6699">Very well. I&apos;ll speak with your Queen.</string>
  <string id="6700">What do we do here, team?</string>
  <string id="6702">Who is the Queen?</string>
  <string id="6703">Wait a minute. You know who I am?</string>
  <string id="6704">Have worrrk to do....</string>
  <string id="6705">Queennn speaks to outsidersss....</string>
  <string id="6706">Do nnnot touch me, invaderrr....</string>
  <string id="6707">Precious ennnergy....</string>
  <string id="6708">I smell ennnergy in you....</string>
  <string id="6709">The Queennn loves us alllll....</string>
  <string id="6710">Here we are safe frommm the Zoah....</string>
  <string id="6711">Away, innnvaderrrs....</string>
  <string id="6712">Stay back... invaderrrs....</string>
  <string id="6713">Lady Shade... you returnnn....</string>
  <string id="6714">We are nnnot afraid of you....</string>
  <string id="6715">The Queennn gives you honorrr.</string>

  <string id="6721">Smmmart crrreature. Come nnnow. I take to you herrr....</string>
  <string id="6722">Let&apos;s go in, but keep your eyes open. Be ready for anything.</string>
  <string id="6724">I knnnow you are Zoah spies. Make nnno suddennn moves....</string>
  <string id="6725">The Queennn will decide that whennn you are brought before herrr....</string>
  <string id="6726">Brutish giants filled with hate. But they try to kill usss with ennnergy annnd we devourrr it....</string>
  <string id="6727">Do nnnot keep the Queennn waitinnng, Zoah spiesss....</string>
  <string id="6733">We are not Zoah spies!</string>
  <string id="6734">What do you know about the Zoah?</string>
  <string id="6736">Give did Lord Ix a crystal. Had the crystal great power, but know not I what. Took he it back when fought we him.</string>
  <string id="6737">Could it be a Chaos Emerald?</string>
  <string id="6738">Saved you have the Kron. Take you the crystal.</string>
  <string id="6739">Do you this, and take you the crystal within the factory.</string>
  <string id="6740">Crystal? Maybe he means the Chaos Emerald!</string>
  <string id="6741">Wait... What crystal?</string>
  <string id="6746">Welcommme back....</string>
  <string id="6747">Welcommme here....</string>
  <string id="6749">Evennn innnvaders nnneed supplies....</string>
  <string id="6751">Returrrn later, friennnds....</string>
  <string id="6754">You&apos;re welcoming us?</string>
  <string id="6756">We have work to do. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="6758">State your business, invaders! Or we&apos;ll assume you to be N&apos;rrgal spies.</string>
  <string id="6759">You recognize me, don&apos;t you?</string>
  <string id="6760">Who dares-- Ah, yes. We recognize her, don&apos;t we boys? And she brought Sonic the Hedgehog, too!</string>
  <string id="6763">A traitor and Public Enemy Number 1, both right in front of us. This must be my lucky day.</string>
  <string id="6764">Let&apos;s bring them in, boys. I smell a promotion in my future.</string>
  <string id="6767">You shot us down, big guy. Did you expect us to go without a fight?</string>
  <string id="6769">Careful, Sonic. They appear to be using some kind of high-tech energy stun-beams.</string>
  <string id="6770">Sonic... Sonic the Hedgehog, Public Enemy Number 1. Yes. Ha ha ha! Listen to this, boys! This must be our lucky day!</string>
  <string id="6784">Yesss.... Sonnnic the Hedgehog.... Do commme innn....</string>
  <string id="6786">Mannny timmmes have we heard your name. You are annn ennnemy of Lord Ixxx, and thus annn ennnemy of the N&apos;rrgal Hive....</string>
  <string id="6789">But nnnow you are here, annnd we have a nnnew way to ennnd the connnflict. A much... cleanerrr way....</string>
  <string id="6793">We have annn offer to mmmake you. Annn offer that winnns you your freedommm....</string>
  <string id="6794">The Zoah have a nnnew secret weaponnn, rumored to be powerfulll ennnough to destroy the N&apos;rrgal race onnnce annnd for all....</string>
  <string id="6795">Innn his innnfinite wisdommm, Lord Ixxx gifted us with the Gemmm of Power, a gem so powerful that the Zoah dare nnnot attack us....</string>
  <string id="6796">Gem of Power? Could it be the Chaos Emerald?</string>
  <string id="6797">Nnnow nnneither race attacks the other, out of fear that both races will be destroyed. But we do nnnot trust the Zoah to be prudennnt....</string>
  <string id="6798">We do nnnot fear the Zoah. Their ennnergy weaponnns cannnot hurt us. But their secret weaponnn frightennns us.... </string>
  <string id="6799">Go. Steal the Zoah weaponnn and returrrn with it in tow....</string>
  <string id="6800">We will forget that we captured you and givvve you this Chaos Emmmerald you so pathetically crrrave....</string>
  <string id="6801">Mmmy workers will recharge your ship annnd give coordinnnates to the Zoah Colony....</string>
  <string id="6802">Onnnce there, steal the weaponnn and returrrn it to us....</string>
  <string id="6803">This audiennnce is over. Leave us nnnow....</string>
  <string id="6804">Without their secret weaponnn, the Zoah would never conquerrr the N&apos;rrgal....</string>
  <string id="6805">With nnno threat from the secret weaponnn, we have nnno nnneed for this Gemmm of Power to deter the ennnemy....</string>
  <string id="6806">If we sennnt N&apos;rrgal warriors, it would be annn act of war. The Zoah would nnnot hesitate to use their weaponnn against us....</string>
  <string id="6807">Nnneed we reminnnd you, your freedommm is at stake....</string>
  <string id="6808">It glowsss with a pleasinnng light. And power flows frommm it, like starlight....</string>
  <string id="6809">That&apos;s a Chaos Emerald, all right.</string>
  <string id="6810">Chaos Emmerald, Gemmm of Power, yes. Lord Ixxx is a gennnerous ruler....</string>
  <string id="6811">He did.... Nnnot a surprise. Lord Ixxx protects his subjects....</string>
  <string id="6812">Lord Ixxx has givennn us the mmmeannns to defennnd ourselves: a Gem of Power with which we could elimmminnnate the hated Zoah. Should the nnneed arise....</string>
  <string id="6813">The Zoah are a warlike race that livvves on a nnnearby plannnetoid. Evvver sinnnce we arrrived here, the Zoah havvve tried to connquer usss....</string>
  <string id="6817">We&apos;re looking for a Chaos Emerald.</string>
  <string id="6828">So, what do you want from us?</string>
  <string id="6831">Then we&apos;re on our way.</string>
  <string id="6835">So you&apos;ll just give us the Chaos Emerald?</string>
  <string id="6837">Why don&apos;t you send your warriors to do this?</string>
  <string id="6839">Tell me more about the Gem of Power.</string>
  <string id="6841">Ix gave you a Chaos Emerald?</string>
  <string id="6842">Did you know he gave one to the Kron, too?</string>
  <string id="6843">Why would you work for Ix?</string>
  <string id="6844">That sounds like the Chaos Emerald we&apos;re looking for.</string>
  <string id="6845">Why do you hate the Zoah so much?</string>
  <string id="6848">What a bunch of meanies!</string>
  <string id="6849">Sonic, I think I can repair the ship, but they&apos;ve locked her in a stasis field. We can&apos;t take off until we lower that field!</string>
  <string id="6850">We have to find that Zoah secret weapon, anyway. If we return to the N&apos;rrgal Colony without it, we&apos;ll be captured and executed!</string>
  <string id="6851">If I ever thought I&apos;d have sympathy for the Zoah, it&apos;s all gone now.</string>
  <string id="6852">Let&apos;s explore. There&apos;s definitely a Chaos Emerald here somewhere.</string>
  <string id="6853">I can see soldiers everywhere. It&apos;s a good bet they&apos;ll be looking for us. </string>
  <string id="6854">So! Where to now?</string>
  <string id="6855">It looks like the N&apos;rrgal have locked the Cyclone onto the Zoah Colony. I can&apos;t change our navigation to anywhere else!</string>
  <string id="6856">Hm. So we&apos;re still her prisoners, then.</string>
  <string id="6857"> Until we steal that Zoah weapon, it appears so.</string>
  <string id="6858">Then we know what we have to do. Let&apos;s do it!</string>
  <string id="6859">Sonic, I&apos;m getting a reading... a Chaos Emerald! I wonder if that&apos;s the secret weapon the Queen was talking about!</string>
  <string id="6861">Why would Ix give both sides a Chaos Emerald if they&apos;re sworn enemies?</string>
  <string id="6862">Lord Ix is shrewd. It could be he wants to play them against each other. </string>
  <string id="6866">Coming in over the Zoah Colony now. T-minus--</string>
  <string id="6868">Why are they shooting at us?</string>
  <string id="6869">If I were coming with the Nocturnus, we&apos;d have been cloaked. The Zoah are doing what the Zoah do best.</string>
  <string id="6870">Evasive maneuvers!</string>
  <string id="6872">We&apos;re going down!</string>
  <string id="6874">Ugh. I can&apos;t believe we have to ride in this ship after those... things were all over it.</string>
  <string id="6875">You&apos;d rather stay here?</string>
  <string id="6905">Returrrn with the Zoah weaponnn and the Queennn will see you....</string>
  <string id="6906">Come, please! Out of the open!</string>
  <string id="6907">The soldiers are on the prowl today. Best be careful! Especially with that Night Stalker beast around!</string>
  <string id="6908">I am but a humble trader, licensed to sell to the military but forbidden to sell to anyone else.</string>
  <string id="6909">Let me tell you: a chance to deny General Raxos&apos; dogs their quarry doesn&apos;t come along all that often. You&apos;re doing me a favor.</string>
  <string id="6910">Hm. Yes, I think I do.</string>
  <string id="6911">I remember the day it arrived. A large gem, right?</string>
  <string id="6913">That sounds like a Chaos Emerald.</string>
  <string id="6914">Do you know where we could find the Emerald?</string>
  <string id="6915">Oh, you can&apos;t. It&apos;s a personal treasure of General Raxos. The only way to get it would be to issue an official Challenge.</string>
  <string id="6916">Speak to the guards at the front gate of the base. Tell them you want to petition for the Right of Challenge.</string>
  <string id="6917">I can&apos;t beg you enough not to make a Challenge, though. Please reconsider.</string>
  <string id="6918">I--I&apos;m afraid I&apos;ve sent you to your deaths. If you must make a Challenge, then good luck.</string>
  <string id="6919">Yes. Anyway, I&apos;ve enjoyed our talk. I&apos;ll miss you after the General sends you away for good.</string>
  <string id="6921">We were right! The weapon IS a Chaos Emerald!</string>
  <string id="6922">What?! I never said that! Who told you that?!</string>
  <string id="6923">Listen... you have to keep stuff like that to yourself. General Raxos&apos; soldiers are good at... hearing things.</string>
  <string id="6930">Lord Ix Challenged General Raxos a long, long time ago, and Ix won. For his prize, Lord Ix demanded the Zoah&apos;s allegiance.</string>
  <string id="6931">In Zoah law, anyone who defeats the General in combat can make a demand on the General. Even if that demand is for control of the Zoah.</string>
  <string id="6932">Come back any time.</string>
  <string id="6936">He is the leader of the military here, and a generally unpleasant fellow. He&apos;s a great ruler, but he&apos;s gotten... unpredictable.</string>
  <string id="6937">When the Nocturnus arrived, he pledged allegiance to them, which was shocking. A Zoah hardly swears loyalty to his own mother, frankly.</string>
  <string id="6938">Still, Lord Ix did defeat him in an official Challenge, so I suppose there&apos;s no fighting it.</string>
  <string id="6939">What? Why would I do that? You&apos;re only the most wanted group of creatures this colony has ever seen!</string>
  <string id="6940">Yes, yes. Not so cheerful a place, this. </string>
  <string id="6943">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="6945">Do you know anything about a secret weapon?</string>
  <string id="6951">Tell me about official Challenges.</string>
  <string id="6952">How do I make an official Challenge?</string>
  <string id="6954">Don&apos;t worry. We can handle this.</string>
  <string id="6955">Yes, maybe challenging the General isn&apos;t the best idea.</string>
  <string id="6958">You don&apos;t seem to like the military very much.</string>
  <string id="6968">We have work to do.</string>
  <string id="6973">Who is General Raxos?</string>
  <string id="6976">Are you trying to hide us?</string>
  <string id="6978">Finally! A friendly face.</string>
  <string id="6982">I can&apos;t be seen talking to you.</string>
  <string id="6983">No. I have work to do.</string>
  <string id="6984">The General is tough, but fair.</string>
  <string id="6985">They&apos;re watching. </string>
  <string id="6986">When will this day be over?</string>
  <string id="6987">I wonder if it&apos;s like this everywhere.</string>
  <string id="6988">*sigh*</string>
  <string id="6989">I heard the N&apos;rrgal are coming.</string>
  <string id="6990">Are the guards looking this way?</string>
  <string id="6991">Then we&apos;ll be careful. </string>
  <string id="6992">Let&apos;s go, team.</string>
  <string id="6996">I hear you issued a Challenge to General Raxos... and won!</string>
  <string id="6998">Many cheers for the heroes of the day!</string>
  <string id="6999">Of course! I&apos;ll not keep you!</string>
  <string id="7000">Welcome back, friends. How may I serve you?</string>
  <string id="7001">Of course. Come back any time.</string>
  <string id="7004">Thanks! We had better get going.</string>
  <string id="7006">We&apos;d better be going.</string>
  <string id="7009">For the second time in the history of this colony, I have been defeated. </string>
  <string id="7011">We did it!</string>
  <string id="7013">Silence! I hoped you could defeat me. I hoped for a chance to escape Lord Ix&apos;s rule.</string>
  <string id="7014">But that required a champion powerful enough to defeat Lord Ix. I believe that Sonic and his friends are those champions.</string>
  <string id="7015">But sir....</string>
  <string id="7016">Silence, Syrax. Have the weapon brought to your champions.</string>
  <string id="7018">It is yours now. Do with it as you will. The Zoah welcome you, now. We no longer need fear Lord Ix.</string>
  <string id="7019">You have challenged and defeated me. There is nothing else but to give you my respect.</string>
  <string id="7020">We will do as we always have. We will let Lord Ix believe we serve him still, but when you are ready to defeat him, we will be there.</string>
  <string id="7021">My advisors and I will retreat to make plans for a future attack on Lord Ix. The Zoah Colony is open to you, and your ship has been released from the stasis field.</string>
  <string id="7022">We support you, but we cannot aid you. Not until it is clear that the tide will turn.</string>
  <string id="7023">Well done. Well done!</string>
  <string id="7024">Through great effort, you have won the right to be destroyed by the General of the Zoah.</string>
  <string id="7025">But there are four of you, and only one of me. </string>
  <string id="7026">So let&apos;s make this fair.</string>
  <string id="7027">So, what, should I tie my hands behind my back?</string>
  <string id="7029">Now, N&apos;rrgal spy, enemy of Lord Ix. Let&apos;s see what you&apos;ve got.</string>
  <string id="7031">Heed! I, General Raxos, answer the Challenge!</string>
  <string id="7032">But first, you must prove yourselves worthy. I will not waste my time on fools who are not worth the effort!</string>
  <string id="7033">Defeat my Champion, and you may face me! Ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="7035">I have looked forward to this. </string>
  <string id="7036">Let the battle begin!</string>
  <string id="7037">I will enjoy taking you apart.</string>
  <string id="7039">Silence!</string>
  <string id="7040">Who&apos;s that?</string>
  <string id="7041">You have passed your test, scrappy little spies. But I understand you petitioned for the Right of Challenge.</string>
  <string id="7042">Heed, my Zoah! Before you stand enemies of Lord Ix! They have survived to win their citizenship, and now they dare to challenge me!</string>
  <string id="7044">Sonic the Hedgehog! Before you receive your defeat, you may name your terms. </string>
  <string id="7045">Ah! Then you ARE N&apos;rrgal spies! Ha ha ha! And you managed to petition for citizenship! Well done.</string>
  <string id="7046">Our secret weapon is a great and powerful gem, a gift from Lord Ix to reward Zoah loyalty and to give us an edge against the hated N&apos;rrgal. </string>
  <string id="7047">But you know that already, don&apos;t you, N&apos;rrgal spy?</string>
  <string id="7048">The secret weapon is a gem? Then... Could it be the Chaos Emerald?</string>
  <string id="7049">You are weak, soft creatures. And you will not survive the Challenge. So the weapon remains mine.</string>
  <string id="7051">Very well. Let it begin.</string>
  <string id="7052">Oh, woe! If only you could Challenge me and win, then perhaps you could have it. </string>
  <string id="7053">Sadly, my tiny furry foes, you are not citizens. And so I will not have the pleasure of crushing you.</string>
  <string id="7054">Mighty General, I beg for the right to sponsor them as citizens. I would love nothing more than to see them destroyed.</string>
  <string id="7055">If my Champion wishes it, then it is so. You may face me for possession of our greatest weapon.</string>
  <string id="7056">The Emerald... Then you must be after our secret weapon!</string>
  <string id="7057">The mighty Lord Ix came to this land and petitioned for a Challenge. When he won, he sealed the loyalty of the Zoah race.</string>
  <string id="7058">Anyone who defeats me in a Challenge is free to make a single demand. Ix demanded that the Zoah bow before him.</string>
  <string id="7059">No. We fight. There is no way out.</string>
  <string id="7060">If we defeat him, he must give us what we ask. That is worth the risk.</string>
  <string id="7061">I can see several ways out for me. None for you.</string>
  <string id="7062">Maybe we could... no, I think we&apos;re stuck.</string>
  <string id="7063">Go for the face. I find boorish men hate it when you go for the face.</string>
  <string id="7064">I say we try. We can do it!</string>
  <string id="7065">I&apos;m scared, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="7066">POSSIBILITY OF SUCCESS IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE. RECOMMEND WE TRY.</string>
  <string id="7067">I have to go! Really really go!</string>
  <string id="7068">Name your terms!</string>
  <string id="7079">Thank you, Raxos.</string>
  <string id="7080">That&apos;s it? After all that, we&apos;re all just friends?</string>
  <string id="7081">What will you do now?</string>
  <string id="7083">Will you join us against Ix?</string>
  <string id="7105">We have come to take your secret weapon!</string>
  <string id="7110">We&apos;ll see about that!</string>
  <string id="7116">Then we challenge you for the Chaos Emerald!</string>
  <string id="7117">We are here for the Chaos Emerald!</string>
  <string id="7119">Why are you working for Ix?</string>
  <string id="7121">Then we challenge you for your secret weapon!</string>
  <string id="7122">Then we challenge you for the Chaos Emerald!</string>
  <string id="7123">Hey, team! Anyone see any other way out of this?</string>
  <string id="7133">Come this way.</string>
  <string id="7135">Just through these doors. A gentleman will be along to assist you.</string>
  <string id="7136">Ha ha ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="7137">Well, well. If it isn&apos;t Public Enemy Number One.</string>
  <string id="7138">Come to turn yourself in?</string>
  <string id="7139">Oh, is that so? And on what grounds?</string>
  <string id="7140">We demand that General Raxos turn over the Chaos Emerald!</string>
  <string id="7141">Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! You guys get that, brothers! It wants a Challenge!</string>
  <string id="7142">Well, little spy, the Right of Challenge is the right of all citizens, so we can hardly deny you.</string>
  <string id="7143">Of course, you, little criminal, are NOT a citizen. You will have to apply for citizenship first.</string>
  <string id="7144">Ha ha ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="7145">Excellent. Come with us.</string>
  <string id="7146">It&apos;s easy! Just come with us. We&apos;ll help you.</string>
  <string id="7147">Application for citizenship is a sacred process. We would never interfere in that.</string>
  <string id="7148">I hoped you&apos;d say that. Boys! Let&apos;s take &apos;em!</string>
  <string id="7149">Oh, are you? And what would something like you do with such a powerful gem?</string>
  <string id="7150">Gem? Could he mean the Chaos Emerald?</string>
  <string id="7151">Chaos Emerald? Ah, you&apos;re after the secret weapon!</string>
  <string id="7152">How pleased General Raxos will be when he hears that Lord Ix&apos;s greatest foe is also a N&apos;rrgal spy!</string>
  <string id="7153">Fight if you want. I will take you in anyway.</string>
  <string id="7155">Is that so? Then you will get your wish.</string>
  <string id="7156">The General will gladly speak with you once your trial date has arrived. If Lord Ix hasn&apos;t come to collect you by then.</string>
  <string id="7162">We&apos;re here to petition for a Challenge!</string>
  <string id="7168">Then we apply for citizenship.</string>
  <string id="7170">How do we do that?</string>
  <string id="7171">Why should we trust you?</string>
  <string id="7172">Forget it. We&apos;ll just take the Emerald from you.</string>
  <string id="7173">We&apos;re going to take your secret weapon.</string>
  <string id="7176">We&apos;re looking for a Chaos Emerald.</string>
  <string id="7181">We want to speak with General Raxos.</string>
  <string id="7184">Here come some more!</string>
  <string id="7185">What&apos;s going on?</string>
  <string id="7186">More bad guys. Let&apos;s get &apos;em!</string>
  <string id="7188">Where are we?</string>
  <string id="7189">I don&apos;t know.</string>
  <string id="7190">Mister Gentleman?</string>
  <string id="7191">Is there someone out there?</string>
  <string id="7193">What&apos;s all this about?</string>
  <string id="7194">No time! Get ready, team!</string>
  <string id="8010">Most impressive. I&apos;ve never seen anyone defeat the General.</string>
  <string id="8011">Keep moving.</string>
  <string id="8012">We&apos;re against Lord Ix now. That doesn&apos;t seem right.</string>
  <string id="8013">One day, the Zoah will rule over the Nocturnus.</string>
  <string id="8014">With Lord Ix out of the way, the N&apos;rrgal&apos;s days will be numbered.</string>
  <string id="8015">You took the weapon. We&apos;ll be watching you.</string>
  <string id="8016">General Raxos knows what he is doing.</string>
  <string id="8017">We know your weakness.</string>
  <string id="8020">We&apos;re back!</string>
  <string id="8023">What&apos;s that, friends?</string>
  <string id="8024">Apolllogies forrr the disssplay.... We are innn a hurry to knnnow what you founnnd....</string>
  <string id="8026">It isss a gemmm like our Gemmm of Power....</string>
  <string id="8027">Yes. This is a Chaos Emerald. Ix stole these from our world, and he gave one to both you and the Zoah.</string>
  <string id="8028">Thennn Lord Ixxx lied to usss....</string>
  <string id="8029">And everyone seems so surprised.</string>
  <string id="8033">Take thisss, our Gemmm of Power. Use it to destroy Lord Ixxx. He will pay for his liesss....</string>
  <string id="8034">Connnsider yourselves free to roammm our homelannnd. Nnno N&apos;rrgal will attack you.</string>
  <string id="8035">Have cautionnn: We have heard the Nocturnnnus have lannnded. They will be lookinnng for you. </string>
  <string id="8039">I&apos;ll never get used to that.</string>
  <string id="8040">Way to go, team! Now we have three of the Chaos Emeralds!</string>
  <string id="8041">Our next destination should be Sector Charyb, home of the Voxai. </string>
  <string id="8042">We have time to take a breather, Sonic. If there&apos;s anything else we want to do here, we can take care of that now.</string>
  <string id="8047">All right! We have five of the Chaos Emeralds!</string>
  <string id="8048">When you&apos;re ready, we should meet on the Cyclone to talk about what to do next.</string>
  <string id="8049">Right! Let&apos;s put our heads together, team!</string>
  <string id="8050">We can do that! Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="8051">There is nnno peace with the Zoah, but we will work to brinng hostilities to... mannnageable levelsss.</string>
  <string id="8052">The Nocturnnnus are too powerful for usss to fight, but we wish you llluck, annnd we will aid you the bessst we cannn.</string>
  <string id="8053">It looks like the stasis field has been lifted!</string>
  <string id="8054">We have to fly back to the N&apos;rrgal Colony! Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="8062">We have the Zoah secret weapon.</string>
  <string id="8071">Thank you.</string>
  <string id="8087">Let&apos;s do that now.</string>
  <string id="8089">I want to fly somewhere else.</string>
  <string id="8090">Will there be peace with the Zoah now?</string>
  <string id="8091">Will you fight with us against Ix?</string>
  <string id="8094">And here they are, the heroes of the moment!</string>
  <string id="8095">Just remember who helped you get there. If we hadn&apos;t shown you the way to citizenship....</string>
  <string id="8096">Yes. You really helped us out back there.</string>
  <string id="8097">Don&apos;t ever do it again.</string>
  <string id="8098">Er... right. Whatever you say.</string>
  <string id="8106">So, what do we do now?</string>
  <string id="8107">We need to get the Chaos Emerald back to the N&apos;rrgal Queen. Until we do that, the Cyclone won&apos;t fly anywhere else!</string>
  <string id="8108">What if she tries to take the Emerald?</string>
  <string id="8109">I think we can make her see reason. If we tell her the Zoah have turned their backs on Ix, maybe she&apos;ll do the same.</string>
  <string id="8110">We should get moving. If there&apos;s anything else we need to do here, let&apos;s be quick about it.</string>
  <string id="8116">Go forth and defeat the Nocturnus.</string>
  <string id="8129">This seems to be the security room.</string>
  <string id="8130">If we close the security doors, we can cut the guards off from this part of the building. Unfortunately, we might lose access to other areas. </string>
  <string id="8131">I believe this is the main power room. </string>
  <string id="8132">If we shut down the main power, it should disable the security.</string>
  <string id="8133">Well done against those Zoah guards. But we&apos;ll have to be cautious here. There&apos;s no doubt the Zoah will have state-of-the-art security.</string>
  <string id="8134">The Zoah also know we&apos;re here. We will face many Zoah patrols while we&apos;re inside. </string>
  <string id="8135">Be on your guard.</string>
  <string id="8147">We&apos;ll be careful. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="8156">It wasn&apos;t his to give! He stole it from us!</string>
  <string id="8157">Give us the Chaos Emerald before we decide to take it!</string>
  <string id="8158">Our secret weapon--this &quot;Chaos Emerald&quot;--was a gift from Lord Ix to reward Zoah loyalty and give us an edge against the hated N&apos;rrgal.</string>
  <string id="8159">Well then? What will it be? Will you face defeat in the arena, or the dishonor of execution?</string>
  <string id="8162">General Raxos, the prisoners are accused of sabotage. They were caught attempting to steal the weapon given us by the mighty Lord Ix!</string>
  <string id="8164">Ooh... Saboteurs! No one has had the nerve to try that in a while.</string>
  <string id="8165">In the name of the Zoah Empire and the powerful General Raxos, I propose that the accused be imprisoned to await execution!</string>
  <string id="8167">Has the condemned anything to say?</string>
  <string id="8168">Give us the Emerald, Raxos, and no one gets hurt!</string>
  <string id="8172">We challenge you for the Chaos Emerald!</string>
  <string id="8185">There it is! The Chaos Emerald!</string>
  <string id="8186">This seems too easy.</string>
  <string id="8189">Take another step. I want an excuse to hurt you.</string>
  <string id="8190">I would not be so sure.</string>
  <string id="8191">I am Commander Syrax, high dictator of the 5th Rampager Legion, and chief counsel to the great and powerful General Raxos.</string>
  <string id="8192">It&apos;s too late for that.</string>
  <string id="8193">You have attempted to steal the secret weapon of the Zoah, given by the mighty Lord Ix himself.</string>
  <string id="8194">The Chaos Emerald is their secret weapon?</string>
  <string id="8195">It gives me great pleasure to place you under arrest. Soldiers, set weapons to stun. Believe it or not, we want them alive.</string>
  <string id="8196">General Raxos may not be so kind.</string>
  <string id="8205">We&apos;re taking the Emerald, and you can&apos;t stop us!</string>
  <string id="8207">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="8209">We don&apos;t want trouble.</string>
  <string id="9847">(No! Turn back, outerminds! Turn back!)</string>
  <string id="9848">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="9850">(My name is Thebes. And you are Sonic the Hedgehog, and these are your friends. At least for now.)</string>
  <string id="9851">(Enemies of the Nocturnus are not welcome here! If you value your free will, leave now!)</string>
  <string id="9852">(What?! You&apos;re after the-- Ah, of course. The Great Emeralds--your Chaos Emeralds, I see--were stolen from your world. It is only natural to want them back.)</string>
  <string id="9853">(Such purpose... I envy you.)</string>
  <string id="9854">(I can&apos;t... I don&apos;t.... I&apos;m sorry. I feel so lost!)</string>
  <string id="9855">(But you... such purpose. You seek powerful gems.... Yes, the Chaos Emeralds! The Great Emeralds that power the Overmind!)</string>
  <string id="9856">(I know the Overmind is hunting you, and your minds tell me of your deeds in Sector Scylla. The Zoah and N&apos;rrgal, reconciled!)</string>
  <string id="9857">(I think we can help each other, to get you your Chaos Emeralds, and to bring freedom to the Voxai!)</string>
  <string id="9859">(Come to my home. We will make plans, and we will know what to do next!)</string>
  <string id="9863">(Be careful! The Overmind could act through any of the Voxai! You&apos;ll never know who is hostile until it&apos;s too late!)</string>
  <string id="9864">He&apos;s leaving! He&apos;s flying to the southeast. That must be where his home is!</string>
  <string id="9865">What a strange person-- er, manta-jellyfish... thing.</string>
  <string id="9866">He seems lonely.</string>
  <string id="9867">We should try to help him!</string>
  <string id="9868">He might be our best chance at getting the Chaos Emeralds.</string>
  <string id="9869">And our best chance at escaping the Overmind!</string>
  <string id="9870">(The Overmind knows you are here, but it can&apos;t find you... not yet. Maybe your own Emerald shields you from their power.)</string>
  <string id="9871">(It won&apos;t protect you forever, but you are far from the Overmind. You should be safe for now.)</string>
  <string id="9872">(Shh! Please! No one can know I am an outermind like you.)</string>
  <string id="9873">(I will explain when we meet in private. Until then, please, tell no one!)</string>
  <string id="9874">(The Overmind is hunting you, but your minds tell me of great deeds in your past. One named Eggman, defeated and befriended.)</string>
  <string id="9875">(I saw your names and faces in your minds. I&apos;m sorry, I thought you had done the same to me, until I remembered you are outerminds.)</string>
  <string id="9876">(Your mind is outside the Overmind. You are outerminds.)</string>
  <string id="9877">(I understand how you feel. The loneliness, the fear, the silence....)</string>
  <string id="9878">(What am I--I&apos;m sorry. Please, you must go now!)</string>
  <string id="9879">(Please. I don&apos;t... We don&apos;t have time! Even now it is probing, searching for your minds! You must leave!)</string>
  <string id="9885">We&apos;re not leaving without the Chaos Emeralds!</string>
  <string id="9888">What&apos;s going on here?</string>
  <string id="9895">We will meet you there!</string>
  <string id="9905">And if the Overmind comes after us?</string>
  <string id="9907">Then we will meet you at your home!</string>
  <string id="9908">How are you not controlled by the Overmind?</string>
  <string id="9911">How did you know my name?</string>
  <string id="9912">What is an &quot;outermind&quot;?</string>
  <string id="9915">Tell me about the Overmind.</string>
  <string id="9916">(Greetings, outerminds.)</string>
  <string id="9919">(Ah! You have met Thebes!)</string>
  <string id="9920">(Thebes came to me when I first become an outermind. I sought a purpose, and Thebes gave me one.)</string>
  <string id="9924">(He is a hero. His purpose is to find and protect those of us who become outerminds.)</string>
  <string id="9925">(I won&apos;t say much more. I don&apos;t know who might be listening.)</string>
  <string id="9926">(Oh, I couldn&apos;t say. One day I was inside, doing as the Overmind wished, and the next, everything is... silent.)</string>
  <string id="9927">(I dare not say more. Since I became an outermind, I have done my best to pretend I am otherwise.)</string>
  <string id="9929">(It&apos;s difficult, pretending to have purpose when all purpose is gone.)</string>
  <string id="9930">(It used to be I knew my purpose at all times. The Overmind wanted me to be a trader, so I was.)</string>
  <string id="9931">(The Overmind never forced us to do anything, but it was nice not to doubt my purpose in life.)</string>
  <string id="9932">(Now... Outerminds lose that. Now I feel conflict. What do I do next? Where is the voice to direct my life?)</string>
  <string id="9933">(I know. And I am frightened. What if I choose the wrong action? What... what if I choose no action at all?)</string>
  <string id="9934">(You must have dealt with this all your lives, outerminds. But it&apos;s all new to me.)</string>
  <string id="9936">(Very well. Good day.)</string>
  <string id="9937">(Friends! You have returned!)</string>
  <string id="9938">(Of course! Come back anytime!)</string>
  <string id="9941">Do you know a Voxai named Thebes?</string>
  <string id="9947">What can you tell me about Thebes?</string>
  <string id="9949">How did you become an outermind?</string>
  <string id="9954">What&apos;s all this about a purpose?</string>
  <string id="9957">But now you&apos;re free to decide for yourself!</string>
  <string id="9962">Nothing for now.</string>
  <string id="9964">We have work to do.</string>
  <string id="9966">(Oh no.... My friends!)</string>
  <string id="9967">(The Overmind must have moved the Emerald already! That must be how they took control of my friends!)</string>
  <string id="9968">(We have to act fast! I&apos;ll scout around and see who else has been turned against me.)</string>
  <string id="9970">(Good luck, my friends!)</string>
  <string id="9971">(Welcome. Welcome! I am so glad you came.)</string>
  <string id="9973">(Ugh. Sonic, it&apos;s horrible. We Voxai were once peaceful and carefree. For centuries, the Overmind urged us to build and accomplish great things.)</string>
  <string id="9975">(But not too long ago, the Great Emeralds arrived, and everything changed. The Overmind&apos;s urgings became irresistible commands.)</string>
  <string id="9976">(I hope with all my might that you can help us return things to the way they were.)</string>
  <string id="9977">(The Great Emeralds are kept in Colony Alpha, our main homeworld. But the Overmind plans to move one out here, to Colony Beta.)</string>
  <string id="9979">(If they do that, then we might lose our ability to resist them. But if we can stop them, we can recover the Emerald....)</string>
  <string id="9980">...and protect the Betans from the Overmind&apos;s control!</string>
  <string id="9981">(They captured one of my friends. We can keep our secrets here, but faced with the power of the Overmind....)</string>
  <string id="9982">(I can&apos;t fault my friend for his failure. He had no choice but to tell them about us.)</string>
  <string id="9983">(The Great Emerald will be delivered to Colony Beta very soon. We must move quickly if we want to steal it back!)</string>
  <string id="9984">Hey... why are your friends changing color?</string>
  <string id="9985">(THEBES OF THE VOXAI, YOU ARE FOUND GUILTY OF RESISTING THE OVERMIND!)</string>
  <string id="9986">(REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE OR FACE EXTERMINATION!)</string>
  <string id="9987">(Oh no! Get out of here, Sonic!)</string>
  <string id="9989">(FOOLISH OUTERMINDS! THE OVERMIND WILL HAVE YOU!)</string>
  <string id="9992">(No. There&apos;s nowhere for your ship to land, and the teleporter to Colony Alpha is psychically locked.)</string>
  <string id="9993">(Even if you could get over there, you&apos;d be vulnerable to Overmind control without a Great Emerald to protect you.)</string>
  <string id="9994">(You do. But the Overmind has psychically treated the Great Emeralds. You need one of the Great Emeralds on Colony Alpha.)</string>
  <string id="9995">(Before I became an outermind, I realized that the Overmind was trying to overwhelm our thoughts. They wanted to take over.)</string>
  <string id="9996">(In my mind, I saw thoughts of a world in ruin, with Lord Ix on its throne. I was terrified.)</string>
  <string id="9997">(Now I look into your minds, and I see that it was your world I saw. If we can stop the Overmind, maybe we can save your world, as well.)</string>
  <string id="9998">(Yes, of course. I see that they were stolen from your world. For all I care, they can go back there.)</string>
  <string id="9999">(The Overmind used to give us mental requests that showed us what to do each day. Each Voxai knew his purpose, and everyone worked together.)</string>
  <string id="10000">(But with the Great Emeralds, the Overmind has the power to completely control our minds! They no longer suggest; they command!)</string>
  <string id="10001">That&apos;s horrible!</string>
  <string id="10003">(I am. But more of us become outerminds each day. I think I&apos;m slowly finding my new purpose.)</string>
  <string id="10004">(When the Overmind began to control our minds, some of us fought them.)</string>
  <string id="10006">(We Voxai have powerful minds. When we set our minds to something, we rarely fail.)</string>
  <string id="10007">(I guess freedom is more precious to some of us than to others. Those few are the ones who resist.)</string>
  <string id="10008">(Of course. I see that they were stolen from your world. For all I care, they can go back there.)</string>
  <string id="10009">(But the Great Emeralds are the source of the Overmind&apos;s power of domination. The Overmind won&apos;t give them up without a fight.)</string>
  <string id="10012">We&apos;ll go find the Emerald!</string>
  <string id="10015">What&apos;s going on around here?</string>
  <string id="10020">How can we help?</string>
  <string id="10024">We&apos;ll do it.</string>
  <string id="10025">How did the Overmind learn about the resistance?</string>
  <string id="10027">Let&apos;s get to work.</string>
  <string id="10037">Can&apos;t we just attack Colony Alpha directly?</string>
  <string id="10039">We have a Chaos Emerald already.</string>
  <string id="10040">Why should we help you against the Overmind?</string>
  <string id="10043">Great Emeralds? You mean Chaos Emeralds?</string>
  <string id="10045">What changed when the Emeralds arrived?</string>
  <string id="10049">You seem so lonely now, though.</string>
  <string id="10050">How do you resist the Overmind?</string>
  <string id="10054">We just want the Chaos Emeralds.</string>
  <string id="10056">Here we are. Sector Charyb.</string>
  <string id="10057">This is Voxai Colony Beta. To be honest, I never spent much time working with the Voxai. Lord Ix ordered us to keep our distance.</string>
  <string id="10058">Because he feared they might control your minds?</string>
  <string id="10059">Exactly.</string>
  <string id="10060">The Voxai Overmind keeps peace by controlling and tapping the minds of its people. Nocturnus patrols found themselves watched from all sides.</string>
  <string id="10061">Many of my brethren found themselves under the Overmind&apos;s control. We never saw them again.</string>
  <string id="10064">I think we can rely on the Chaos Emerald to protect us, but when we leave the ship, we might be vulnerable.</string>
  <string id="10065">Hey, last time the Zoah attacked us right when we left the ship. The way I see it, we&apos;re one step ahead already.</string>
  <string id="10066">We don&apos;t have a choice. To take on Ix, you need the Chaos Emeralds. And there were two here in this sector.</string>
  <string id="10067">My mind is strong. I am not worried.</string>
  <string id="10068">My friend, please.... I have seen powerful Nocturnus swayed by the Overmind&apos;s power. I do not wish to see you taken away.</string>
  <string id="10069">I will be fine. </string>
  <string id="10071">Let&apos;s get moving, team. There are two Chaos Emeralds in Sector Charyb, and we have to find them both!</string>
  <string id="10072">Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="10073">Let&apos;s get moving, team. We have to get the Chaos Emeralds!</string>
  <string id="10074">Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="10075">Why is that?</string>
  <string id="10099">Hey! Look over there! Another teleporter!</string>
  <string id="10100"> I wonder where it goes!</string>
  <string id="10107">Strange. No one will talk to us!</string>
  <string id="10108">The Overmind controls them. They move about, doing their jobs, without protest.</string>
  <string id="10109">That&apos;s... sad.</string>
  <string id="10110">But I suppose it&apos;s efficient, at least.</string>
  <string id="10111">Sonic, we have to end this.</string>
  <string id="10113">When has that ever happened?</string>
  <string id="10114">Let&apos;s just keep moving, team. And keep your eyes open.</string>
  <string id="10129">Let&apos;s see if we can find out more.</string>
  <string id="10171">(Good greetings, Thebes. These must be the outerminds you&apos;ve been protecting, no?)</string>
  <string id="10172">(Thelxe!)</string>
  <string id="10173">Who&apos;s that?</string>
  <string id="10174">Thebes called it Thelxe, one of the Overmind&apos;s elite protectors. We may be in significant danger.</string>
  <string id="10175">(Have you come to submit to the Overmind, rebels?)</string>
  <string id="10176">(I... We....)</string>
  <string id="10177">(Such confidence... for an outermind.)</string>
  <string id="10178">(I sense... resistance. Protection. You possess an Emerald of your own. But it&apos;s not enough, is it?)</string>
  <string id="10179">(The power of the Overmind flows through this stone I carry. The power to control... to enslave.)</string>
  <string id="10180">(You will submit, my friends. The Overmind demands it!)</string>
  <string id="10183">(Yes. But the Overmind has them now. The Overmind has changed them.)</string>
  <string id="10184">(They are not the Chaos Emeralds you once knew. Now they are greater, more powerful!)</string>
  <string id="10185">(I don&apos;t fear you, outermind. I protect the greatest power the Twilight Cage has ever known!)</string>
  <string id="10186">(Thebes put himself in this situation the moment he resisted the will of the Overmind. He knows what he has done was wrong.)</string>
  <string id="10187">(I no longer need the Overmind to have a purpose!)</string>
  <string id="10198">We will not submit to you!</string>
  <string id="10205">We&apos;re here for the Chaos Emeralds!</string>
  <string id="10208">Back away now, Thelxe, and we won&apos;t hurt you!</string>
  <string id="10210">Just leave Thebes out of this.</string>
  <string id="10512">(My friends! You did it!)</string>
  <string id="10513">(I sensed concern in the Overmind, and I came to see. You really did it!)</string>
  <string id="10514">We did it together!</string>
  <string id="10515">(I never thought it could be done. You defeated the Overmind and freed us all!)</string>
  <string id="10516">(Please take both Great Emeralds. Return them to your world!)</string>
  <string id="10519">Your people will look to you to lead them, Thebes.</string>
  <string id="10520">(Yes. I see that now.)</string>
  <string id="10522">(I&apos;ll take what remains of the Overmind&apos;s power and lead my people fairly. The Voxai will be free to choose their own purpose, just as I have!)</string>
  <string id="10530">(I pledge to you the friendship of the Voxai race. If you ask, we will help you protect your world from the Nocturnus.)</string>
  <string id="10531">(Of course. It&apos;s the least I can do!)</string>
  <string id="10532">(Please, be careful. My people tell me that the Nocturnus have landed. They must have heard you were here!)</string>
  <string id="10533">(We have to pretend to be loyal to them, as the Overmind were. We&apos;re no match for them right now.)</string>
  <string id="10535">(Consider our colony open to you. Return whenever you like.)</string>
  <string id="10536">(For now, I have work to do! My people need me!)</string>
  <string id="10537">(Thanks to you, I have found my purpose!)</string>
  <string id="10538">(You have freed my people. We owe you everything.)</string>
  <string id="10539">(I won&apos;t.... Oh, ha ha ha, I get it!)</string>
  <string id="10561">Thank you, Thebes.</string>
  <string id="10569">We couldn&apos;t ask that.</string>
  <string id="10571">Don&apos;t let this go to your head, okay?</string>

  <string id="10732">Will you be okay now?</string>
  <string id="10735">Thanks! Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="10736">Did you know about Thebes?</string>
  <string id="10737">We have to go.</string>
  <string id="10776">Let&apos;s go talk to the N&apos;rrgal Queen!</string>
  <string id="10820">(My friends! You did it!)</string>
  <string id="10823">(What will we do now?)</string>
  <string id="10824">(Thebes is a good leader.)</string>
  <string id="10825">(What is my purpose?)</string>
  <string id="10826">(You freed us. Thank you.)</string>
  <string id="10827">(I feel strange. I feel... free.)</string>
  <string id="10828">(I must have slept a long time.)</string>
  <string id="10829">(My mind is clear!)</string>
  <string id="10830">(Thebes will tell us what to do!)</string>
  <string id="10831">(....)</string>
  <string id="10833">Brrrm! Bicker you not over old rivalries! Not this the time for argument!</string>
  <string id="10834">(He&apos;s right! We have to come together for a unified purpose!)</string>
  <string id="10835">Says the new Overmind of the Voxai! Tell me, kid: How long before you had your old friends cleaning out your closets, eh?</string>
  <string id="10836">(I didn&apos;t....)</string>
  <string id="10837">Donnn&apos;t put your annnger on the nnnew onnnes, Zoah. Your problemmms are with usss.</string>
  <string id="10838">(Sonic!)</string>
  <string id="10839">Ah! You&apos;re finally here. Tell this N&apos;rrgal slimeball that--</string>
  <string id="10840">Slimmmeball! Go launnnch an armmmada, you battle-hunnngry beast!</string>
  <string id="10841">Sonic! You have to do something!</string>
  <string id="10842">QUIET!</string>
  <string id="10843">....</string>
  <string id="10844">....</string>
  <string id="10845">....</string>
  <string id="10846">(....)</string>
  <string id="10847">That&apos;s better.</string>
  <string id="10849">We&apos;re all here because we want Ix defeated. And the only way to do that is to take away his power source.</string>
  <string id="10850">Ix stole from our world seven Chaos Emeralds and the Master Emerald. He gave Chaos Emeralds to each of you; we&apos;re not sure why.</string>
  <string id="10851">But he still has two of them, as well as the Master Emerald, which is a very old and powerful relic. With it, I imagine he could enslave you all and destroy our world.</string>
  <string id="10853">Nocturne has a repulsor field around it. We&apos;ve tried for ages to get through it, but it&apos;s unbreakable.</string>
  <string id="10854">There has to be a way through it. If we all work together, then we can find a way.</string>
  <string id="10857">If we could get up there, mmmy dronnnes could eat through the energy field. We could mmmake a hole big ennnough for a small ship to pass through.</string>
  <string id="10858">We&apos;ve fired rockets at Nocturne before. They reached the repulsor field and blew up. Nothing could survive hitting the energy field.</string>
  <string id="10859">Brrm. Mine we an ore that deflects energy. Send we a ship made of such ore. Brmmm. Lodge it we could into repulsor field until chew through it the N&apos;rrgal can. </string>
  <string id="10860">The problem is knowing where to hit the field. We&apos;ll have to hit a weak spot, or we won&apos;t have enough time.</string>
  <string id="10861">(We can extend our senses to Nocturne and detect the weak spots in the field. Then we can send thoughts to the Zoah to help target the weak spots.)</string>
  <string id="10863">If this works, there would be a small hole in the repulsor field just large enough for the Cyclone to fly through!</string>
  <string id="10864">Formed we a plan! Brrrm! Go we now to prepare!</string>
  <string id="10865">Once everything is in place, we&apos;ll wait for your mark to fire, Hedgehog.</string>
  <string id="10866">(Good luck, everyone! We go to fulfil our purpose!)</string>
  <string id="10867">Trust you can.</string>
  <string id="10868">(We&apos;ve fought among ourselves for thousands of years. We&apos;re all here and no one has died: that is a sign that we all want peace.)</string>
  <string id="10869">If it gives us a crack at the Nocturnus, then we&apos;re in.</string>
  <string id="10870">We are trustworrrthy.</string>
  <string id="10871">I have a good feeling about this, Sonic! </string>
  <string id="10872">These four races are working together for the first time ever, just to help us defeat Ix!</string>
  <string id="10873">This is incredible. I never would&apos;ve imagined the Kron, Zoah, N&apos;rrgal, and Voxai working together for a common cause.</string>
  <string id="10874">No doubt Ix worked to keep them at each other&apos;s throats on purpose. He knew if they teamed up, he&apos;d be doomed.</string>
  <string id="10876">Enslaved us did Ix. Defeat him will we.</string>
  <string id="10877">We&apos;ve wanted to be free from Lord Ix for a long time. You can&apos;t count us out now.</string>
  <string id="10878">We will listennn. You have earnnned that much.</string>
  <string id="10879">(You saved my people. We will follow you.)</string>
  <string id="10880">(Do this.... No! You&apos;ll die!)</string>
  <string id="10881">It&apos;s foolishness to take the Nocturnus head on. If it weren&apos;t, we&apos;d have done it ages ago!</string>
  <string id="10882">You cannn&apos;t do this alonnne.</string>
  <string id="10883">Propose you a plan. Listen we will.</string>
  <string id="10884">I had a feeling this would happen. </string>
  <string id="10885">We have to get them to listen!</string>
  <string id="10886">We had no choice! Maybe we can reason with them.</string>
  <string id="10891">Quiet! Everyone!</string>
  <string id="10895">Everyone! Listen up!</string>
  <string id="10917">Then let&apos;s do it!</string>
  <string id="10921">Can we trust you to work together?</string>
  <string id="10925">I want to speak with my team for a moment.</string>
  <string id="10930">If they don&apos;t want to defeat Ix, then why force them?</string>
  <string id="10934">We don&apos;t need them. We can do this ourselves.</string>
  <string id="10938">What&apos;s going on here?</string>
  <string id="10941">Oh no, I had a feeling this was a mistake.</string>
  <string id="11013">I was right. These are Eggman robots.</string>
  <string id="11015">Could Eggman be back? Is that possible?</string>
  <string id="11017">Right!</string>
  <string id="11018">GUN will want to know about these robots. Let&apos;s go tell them now!</string>
  <string id="11019">Oh, I hope we&apos;re wrong about Eggman.</string>
  <string id="11020">Me too, Amy. Me too. </string>
  <string id="11021">Yeah. These ARE Eggman robots, but they&apos;re old models. Damaged. Eggman would never use old, run-down robots. Unless....</string>
  <string id="11023">Unless he&apos;s desperate! Maybe he doesn&apos;t have anything better than this!</string>
  <string id="11025">We&apos;ve beaten him a lot of times before, and every time he&apos;s found some way to come back.</string>
  <string id="11026">I hate to say it, but maybe he found some way to survive the carrier crash!</string>
  <string id="11027">Me too! Those beady little eyes. That great big broom of a moustache!</string>
  <string id="11028">We don&apos;t know for sure that he&apos;s back. But if he is....</string>
  <string id="11030">These look like Eggman&apos;s robots! But there&apos;s something... odd about them.</string>
  <string id="11031">But I thought we defeated Eggman for good!</string>
  <string id="11032">Who cares? Let&apos;s smash &apos;em!</string>
  <string id="11037">I wanted to talk to you, too, Sonic! It feels like forever since you left on your trip.</string>
  <string id="11040">I was happy when Knuckles asked for my help. Between you and me, I was getting bored working by myself.</string>
  <string id="11042">Everything was pretty calm while you were gone. Until the Marauders showed up, that is. </string>
  <string id="11044">I&apos;ve been pretty good. Without you around, I&apos;ve had to handle a few things on my own. </string>
  <string id="11045">Nothing big, but a rampaging bear here, a power outage there. I guess without you, I had to grow up a little bit.</string>
  <string id="11046">But now you&apos;re back! It&apos;ll be just like old times!</string>
  <string id="11047">Sonic! I&apos;m so glad you made it! We have to save Knuckles from those Marauders!</string>
  <string id="11050">We don&apos;t know where they&apos;re keeping him. If we just go out there without a plan, we&apos;ll waste whatever time Knuckles might have left.</string>
  <string id="11051">Luckily, we&apos;re not in this alone. GUN has some ideas where we might look.</string>
  <string id="11052">We&apos;re supposed to go into the city and meet with the GUN Commander and work out a plan.</string>
  <string id="11053">Yeah! Hold on, Knuckles! Here we come!</string>
  <string id="11057">As you know, GUN is the Guardian Units of Nations. They&apos;re the military, Sonic. </string>
  <string id="11058">They helped us when we defeated Eggman, and they&apos;re willing to help again. </string>
  <string id="11059">Not too long ago, Knuckles came to me for help. Six of the seven Chaos Emeralds had been stolen, and he wanted to set up a trap.</string>
  <string id="11060">When the Marauders came to take the last Emerald, they somehow jammed my trap and overcame Knuckles with sheer numbers!</string>
  <string id="11062">By the time I could get the trap working, they were gone!</string>
  <string id="11063">Once they were gone, I came back here and immediately called you, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="11064">And here we are. </string>
  <string id="11065">They had some crazy machines, Sonic. More advanced than anything I could put together. </string>
  <string id="11066">They just pointed at my trap, and it broke! Then they turned on Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="11067">He&apos;s strong, but there were too many! In the end, they overpowered him.</string>
  <string id="11070">If you&apos;d seen him, you wouldn&apos;t say that, Sonic. He knocked out a lot of Marauders before they finally beat him.</string>
  <string id="11072">You might not like to say it, but anyone who can beat Knuckles in a fight is bad news.</string>
  <string id="11074">Yes. So you know how strong the Marauders must be!</string>
  <string id="11076">Sonic! What happened? </string>
  <string id="11078">Why would someone do that? I&apos;m getting a bad feeling about this, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="11079">Good luck, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="11087">That&apos;s strange. The animals in Green Hill Zone aren&apos;t usually that mean! I wonder why that armadillo was so mad?</string>
  <string id="11092">Ahh. Green Hill Zone. We&apos;ve had some good times here, haven&apos;t we, Tails?</string>
  <string id="11093">There&apos;s an armadillo ahead, and it looks angry.</string>
  <string id="11095">It&apos;s strange. The animals in Green Hill Zone usually won&apos;t attack you. I wonder why this one is so mad!</string>
  <string id="11096">Well, there&apos;s no word from Amy yet, so you&apos;re on your own, Sonic. Be careful!</string>
  <string id="11113">Sonic, you made it! I&apos;m so glad to hear from you!</string>
  <string id="11123">We&apos;re in big trouble, Sonic. I don&apos;t know if you heard, but Knuckles has gone missing. And so have the Chaos Emeralds!</string>
  <string id="11127">A group of criminals called the Marauders took him. Please, Sonic! We need your help!</string>
  <string id="11128">I knew you would! I knew it!</string>
  <string id="11129">Amy is on her way to meet you. Once you find her~no, once she finds you, meet me at my workshop near Central City.</string>
  <string id="11130">Great! Thanks, Sonic. With you on the team, I know we&apos;ll save Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="11134">Well, you know how she is. She wanted to meet you halfway and make sure you got here safely.</string>
  <string id="11140">Knuckles was fighting against the Marauders when he disappeared. We&apos;re not really sure who they are, but they&apos;re big trouble!</string>
  <string id="11141">Please, Sonic. I&apos;ll tell you more when you get here!</string>
  <string id="11149">If he&apos;s back, we have to take him out.</string>
  <string id="11154">There&apos;s something strange about these robots.</string>
  <string id="11158">Then let&apos;s take him out while he&apos;s still weak!</string>
  <string id="11159">I don&apos;t believe it. How could Eggman have survived?</string>
  <string id="11162">I had hoped I&apos;d never see Eggman again.</string>
  <string id="11174">I wanted to talk to you for a bit, Tails.</string>
  <string id="11181">We should go speak with GUN.</string>
  <string id="11183">It seems like you&apos;ve been doing well, Tails.</string>
  <string id="11188">Let&apos;s go get him!</string>
  <string id="11191">Then let&apos;s go now. No sense in wasting time.</string>
  <string id="11196">Why do we need to work with GUN?</string>
  <string id="11198">How did he get captured?</string>
  <string id="11202">Then what happened?</string>
  <string id="11204">Then why are we standing here? Let&apos;s go save Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="11205">How could they jam your trap AND defeat Knuckles?</string>
  <string id="11210">Ha! Some guardian Knuckles turned out to be!</string>
  <string id="11213">I know. I&apos;ve beaten him before.</string>
  <string id="11253">I&apos;m here, Tails. What&apos;s going on?</string>
  <string id="11267">Of course I&apos;ll help!</string>
  <string id="11269">Sounds like a plan. I&apos;ll be there in no time!</string>
  <string id="11276">Amy? Ugh! Why do I need to meet up with her?</string>
  <string id="11287">Don&apos;t you know anything about what happened?</string>
  <string id="11296">Since you&apos;re a famous hero, people will come to you for help. </string>
  <string id="11297">It&apos;s up to you if you want to help them out.</string>
  <string id="11298">Let&apos;s keep moving!</string>
  <string id="11299">There&apos;s the wood, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="11300">To cut the wood, just walk up to it and touch the icon over it, or press the L Button or R Button, just like you did to Dash through the loop!</string>
  <string id="11301">I think there&apos;s time to help the poor man out, Sonic. It shouldn&apos;t take too long!</string>
  <string id="11302">Wow. That woodsman looks tired. Maybe we could help him out!</string>
  <string id="11303">To talk to him, walk over and touch the icon over his head, or press either the L Button or R Button. I hope everything is all right!</string>
  <string id="11373">What was that?</string>
  <string id="11374">Sounds like... robots?</string>
  <string id="11375">Robots? Here?</string>
  <string id="11376">Let&apos;s go see what&apos;s going on.</string>
  <string id="11377">Right!</string>
  <string id="11378">Hi, Sonic. I&apos;m not quite ready to go, but I will be soon.</string>
  <string id="11379">Hi, Sonic. I&apos;m not quite ready to go, but I will be soon.</string>
  <string id="11380">I&apos;ll be ready. I promise.</string>
  <string id="11381">Oh? You should be careful, Sonic. I don&apos;t want Dexter to see us spending too much time together!</string>
  <string id="11383">Really?! I mean, sure, Sonic. But be careful, I don&apos;t want Dexter to see us together!</string>
  <string id="11385">Yes. My boyfriend. He is very jealous. He&apos;s not worried about Tails, though, because, well, Tails is Tails, you know?</string>
  <string id="11390">Oh, are we jealous, Sonic? Ha! I knew it!</string>
  <string id="11391">Well, you had your chance, mister!</string>
  <string id="11393">I do say so! I do say so! Ha!</string>
  <string id="11396">Oh, Dexter. My sweetest love.</string>
  <string id="11397">Do you really think so? Really?! </string>
  <string id="11398">I mean, he knows. Did I tell you he always sends me flowers? They&apos;re so beautiful.</string>
  <string id="11399">He has a lot of money, you know. And he&apos;s the most polite man in the world. </string>
  <string id="11400">He treats me just like a princess!</string>
  <string id="11402">Central City. We made it! Even with Marauders trying to stop us!</string>
  <string id="11403">That Marauder wasn&apos;t so tough.</string>
  <string id="11404">We did it!</string>
  <string id="11405">We make a great team, Sonic! Don&apos;t you think so?</string>
  <string id="11406">Y-yeah, sure. I just thought....</string>
  <string id="11407">You&apos;re right. We have things to do. Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="11408">Now that you&apos;re back, we can be together all the time! Think how much fun that will be!</string>
  <string id="11409">I missed this, Sonic. Once we find Knuckles, I hope you&apos;ll stay around!</string>
  <string id="11410">Er, not that I care. I have my beloved Dexter, after all!</string>
  <string id="11412">Hey, where are you going?</string>
  <string id="11414">Well, maybe next time you&apos;re in danger, I won&apos;t &quot;get in your way!&quot; See how you like it!</string>
  <string id="11417">Sonic! Boy, are you lucky I happened to come along!</string>
  <string id="11418">I&apos;m so glad to see you, Sonic. But not THAT glad. I do have a BOYFRIEND now, you know. His name is Dexter!</string>
  <string id="11422">Tails&apos; workshop is still in the northeastern area of Central City. Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="11423">Just don&apos;t get any ideas! I have a boyfriend now, you know.</string>
  <string id="11424">I&apos;m not exactly sure. The animals around here are usually so cute and nice, but they attacked me on my way out here!</string>
  <string id="11425">And those falling blocks.... Someone pushed them over to stop you!</string>
  <string id="11427">Tails says the Marauders got him, but no one knows who they are.</string>
  <string id="11428">I hope he&apos;s all right! Without him to protect the Master Emerald, we could all be in danger!</string>
  <string id="11429">Oh, I&apos;ve been just wonderful! Dexter is so sweet. He always buys me flowers, and he is always nice to me, unlike SOME people I know. </string>
  <string id="11432">Oh yes, my Dexter. </string>
  <string id="11433">Oh, he doesn&apos;t live around here. And he&apos;s very busy, you see. So I&apos;m not sure when he could meet you.</string>
  <string id="11434">I&apos;ll let him know you want to meet him, though! I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll squeeze you in somehow!</string>
  <string id="11435">What?! Good for me?! I thought you&apos;d at least be a little jealous, after all we had together!</string>
  <string id="11436">Well, that&apos;s just fine. What do I care? I have a boyfriend now!</string>
  <string id="11505">Good. We&apos;ll be leaving very soon.</string>
  <string id="11507">I&apos;m not rushing you, Amy, I promise.</string>
  <string id="11509">We&apos;ll be leaving soon.</string>
  <string id="11510">I wanted to talk to you for a bit.</string>
  <string id="11517">Ugh. I&apos;m going to go away now.</string>
  <string id="11519">If you say so, Amy.</string>
  <string id="11524">Tell me more about Dexter.</string>
  <string id="11526">He&apos;s a lucky man, that Dexter.</string>
  <string id="11535">Let&apos;s just keep moving, okay?</string>
  <string id="11538">I had forgotten how much fun working as a team can be.</string>
  <string id="11544">You kept getting in my way.</string>
  <string id="11549">We have to get to Tails, Amy. There&apos;s no time for this.</string>
  <string id="11554">Do you know anything about what&apos;s happening?</string>
  <string id="11556">We don&apos;t have time to stand around and talk. Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="11557">Do you know anything about Knuckles?</string>
  <string id="11560">Then let&apos;s stop wasting time here!</string>
  <string id="11561">How have you been, Amy?</string>
  <string id="11565">That&apos;s quite enough of that. Let&apos;s go find Tails.</string>
  <string id="11566">When can I meet this &quot;Dexter&quot;?</string>
  <string id="11568">Well, good for you, Amy.</string>
  <string id="11570">We&apos;re wasting time! Let&apos;s just go find Tails!</string>
  <string id="11593">Hello, boss. Someone here to see you. </string>
  <string id="11594">Ah! Tails! There you are. And you brought Sonic! Brilliant!</string>
  <string id="11595">Actually, Sonic was nice enough to--</string>
  <string id="11596">That&apos;s lovely. Have a glass of milk and sit down. </string>
  <string id="11597">But I--</string>
  <string id="11598">Tails probably briefed you on the situation, so let us begin.</string>
  <string id="11600">We don&apos;t know why the Marauders wanted the Emeralds, but now that they have them, they&apos;re likely to go after the Master Emerald next. </string>
  <string id="11602">What about Knuckles?</string>
  <string id="11603">Knuckles is the only one who has seen the Marauders up close. He knows more about them than anyone in the world. </string>
  <string id="11604">I believe that to stop the Marauders, you need to extract your friend Knuckles and learn everything you can about them.</string>
  <string id="11605">But Knuckles could be anywhere! We have no idea where to look!</string>
  <string id="11606">Ah yes. Where to look. </string>
  <string id="11607">We have just the thing. </string>
  <string id="11608">Mmm. Hey there, sweetie.</string>
  <string id="11609">I still can&apos;t let you in, handsome. Go get your friend Tails, and I&apos;ll see what I can do for you.</string>
  <string id="11610">Well, well, well. Sonic the Hedgehog. And better looking than ever, I see. You look like you&apos;ve been working out.</string>
  <string id="11613">Leave him alone!</string>
  <string id="11614">Oh, I&apos;m sorry, am I flirting with your man? But here I thought you had a boyfriend!</string>
  <string id="11615">I... I just don&apos;t want you to embarrass Sonic, that&apos;s all.</string>
  <string id="11616">Mmm-hmm.</string>
  <string id="11620">I see the gang&apos;s all here. Let&apos;s go see the Commander. </string>
  <string id="11621">Try to keep up, now.</string>
  <string id="11622">Because I&apos;m the only reason you&apos;re getting in to see the Commander, and the Commander is the one who can help you.</string>
  <string id="11625">Absolutely not!</string>
  <string id="11626">We don&apos;t have much choice. Rouge is a sneak, but she&apos;s our link with GUN. This is our only hope.</string>
  <string id="11628">That doesn&apos;t mean we have to like it.</string>
  <string id="11629">I hate to say it, darlin&apos;, but I can&apos;t let you in here yet. I&apos;m on strict orders to wait until you have that sweet little fox with you.</string>
  <string id="11630">Hurry back, Big Blue. A girl like me can&apos;t wait forever.</string>
  <string id="11631">This is Tails&apos; show, darlin&apos;. I can&apos;t let you in without him to give authorization.</string>
  <string id="11632">You&apos;ve been gone a long time, Big Blue. Tails had to learn to do things without you.</string>
  <string id="11633">He&apos;s come a long way, the scruffy little thing.</string>
  <string id="11634">I&apos;ll gladly tell you all about it once you&apos;re back here with Tails. Until then, I&apos;m afraid I have to remain alluringly mysterious.</string>
  <string id="11677">Thanks, Amy.</string>
  <string id="11682">Right behind you.</string>
  <string id="11684">Why should we follow you, Rouge?</string>
  <string id="11687">Then let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="11688">Are you guys sure we should trust her?</string>
  <string id="11692">Then we&apos;ll go get Tails and come back.</string>
  <string id="11694">Why do we need Tails? Can&apos;t we just go inside?</string>
  <string id="11695">Tails&apos; show? Really? Since when?</string>
  <string id="11697">Who gave you orders not to let me in?</string>
  <string id="11698">Who gave you those orders?</string>
  <string id="11699">GUN Commander gave Sonic a map showing the locations of four Eggman hideouts. The first hideout was empty, but Tails thinks a strange device he found is a communicator of some kind.&#13;
&#13;
The team found the second hideout. Now they must search inside for Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="11700">GUN Commander gave Sonic a map showing the locations of four Eggman hideouts. The first two hideouts were empty, but Tails collected two strange communicators. Tails thinks if he can find more, he can use them to find the communication&apos;s source.&#13;

The team found the third hideout. Now they must search inside for Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="11701">GUN Commander gave Sonic a map showing the locations of four Eggman hideouts. The first three hideouts were empty, but Tails collected three strange communicators. Tails thinks if he can find one more, he can use them to find the communication&apos;s source.&#13;

  <string id="11707">GUN Commander gave Sonic a map showing the locations of four Eggman hideouts. The first two hideouts were empty, but Tails collected three strange communicators. Tails thinks if he can find one more, he can use them to find the communication&apos;s source. He also wonders if there might be a fifth hideout that GUN couldn&apos;t find.&#13;
&#13;
The team must find the other hideouts and search them for signs of Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="11708">In the fourth hideout, Tails found one last communicator. He connected them together, tracked the signals, and discovered that they are all communicating with a secret base in Mystic Ruins!&#13;
&#13;
Sonic and the team must go to Mystic Ruins, south of Central City, to find the secret base... and, hopefully, Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="11711">Blocked!&#13;
&#13;
GUN set up a roadblock to keep anyone, including Sonic and his friends, from going into Mystic Ruins. Luckily, Tails has an ace up his sleeve: The Tornado!</string>
  <string id="11712">Blocked!&#13;
&#13;
GUN set up a roadblock to keep anyone, including Sonic and his friends, from going into Mystic Ruins. Luckily, Tails has an ace up his sleeve: The Tornado!&#13;
&#13;
The Tornado is about ready to fly. Sonic can go speak with any of his friends, but he should talk to Tails when he&apos;s ready to go.</string>
  <string id="11717">Thanks to Tails and the Tornado, the team is in Mystic Ruins!&#13;
&#13;
Now Sonic and his friends must find the secret hideout and save Knuckles before it&apos;s too late!</string>
  <string id="11718">A gas cloud blocks Sonic and team, but it doesn&apos;t seem to bother Big the Cat.&#13;
&#13;
If Sonic gets past the cloud, he can search for the secret base... and Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="11721">After Sonic and friends rescued Knuckles, they looked up to see that Angel Island was gone!&#13;
&#13;
Who could have moved the floating island, and why? Could Eggman be behind this?</string>
  <string id="11724">Tails&apos; tracking device detected an Eggman signature coming from a shop in Central City. What in the shop could have set off the tracker?</string>
  <string id="11725">Tails&apos; detector picked up an Eggman signal coming from a device in a shop in Central City. The shopkeeper thought the device was a coffee machine. Why would a coffee machine set off the Eggman tracker?&#13;
</string>
  <string id="11726">A device in a Central City shop set off Tails&apos; Eggman tracker. A shady salesman named Sal told the store&apos;s shopkeeper the device was a coffee machine and traded it for the shopkeeper&apos;s own prized stapler. But the machine doesn&apos;t make coffee, and the shopkeeper feels cheated.&#13;
&#13;
The shopkeeper promised to give Sonic the device if the team can track down Sal the salesman in Green Hill Zone and get the stapler back.</string>
  <string id="11729">A device in a Central City shop set off Tails&apos; Eggman tracker. A shady salesman named Sal told the store&apos;s shopkeeper the device was a coffee machine and traded it for the shopkeeper&apos;s own prized stapler. But the machine doesn&apos;t make coffee, and the shopkeeper feels cheated.&#13;
&#13;
Sonic found Sal the Salesman in Green Hill Zone and persuaded him to give the stapler back. Now he must return it to its rightful owner!</string>
  <string id="11730">Buyer Beware!</string>
  <string id="11731">Sonic and the team found a forgetful Swatbot! It seems to have forgotten its function.</string>
  <string id="11732">Sonic reminded the forgetful Swatbot that its function was to serve Eggman. Remembering that Sonic was its enemy, the Swatbot attacked!&#13;
&#13;
The team put the Swatbot out of its misery.</string>
  <string id="11733">The Forgetful Swatbot</string>
  <string id="11735">Sonic and the team met Shadow the Hedgehog in Mystic Ruins, but Shadow didn&apos;t want to talk. He sped off without saying anything useful about Eggman.&#13;
&#13;
This probably isn&apos;t the last that Sonic will see of Shadow.</string>
  <string id="11736">As Sonic and the team crossed into Mystic Ruins to search for Eggman, Tails&apos; detector picked up an Eggman signal traveling at high speed... then, a black blur sped by. Shadow!&#13;
&#13;
But what is he up to, and why would he set off the Eggman tracker? To find out, Sonic can search for Shadow in Mystic Ruins.</string>
  <string id="11737">Sonic and his friends defeated Shadow the Hedgehog. Shadow was carrying a strange Eggman device that set off the Eggman tracker. &#13;
&#13;
Shadow ran off on an unknown task, but this isn&apos;t the last Sonic will see of Shadow.</string>
  <string id="11738">Chasing Shadow</string>
  <string id="11739">The team encountered roboticized animals in Mystic Ruins. This surely means that Eggman is back!&#13;
&#13;
If Sonic looks around the area where he first fought the robot animals, maybe he can see where they came from.</string>
  <string id="11740">The team defeated the roboticized animals&apos; leader and claimed the machine that turned the animals into robots.</string>
  <string id="11741">Attack of the Roboarmadillos</string>
  <string id="11742">When tracking an Eggman signal, Tails found a strange device. He isn&apos;t sure what it is.&#13;
&#13;
If Sonic can find more, maybe Tails can figure out what they do!</string>
  <string id="11743">When tracking an Eggman signal, Tails found a second strange device. He still isn&apos;t sure what it is.&#13;
&#13;
Tails noticed that this new device interacts with the other device the team found. If Sonic can find more, maybe Tails can figure out what they do!</string>
  <string id="11744">When tracking an Eggman signal, Tails found a third strange device. He thinks the devices have a few things in common.&#13;
&#13;
If Sonic can find more, maybe Tails can figure out what they do!</string>
  <string id="11745">When tracking an Eggman signal, Tails found another strange device. He thinks he&apos;s just about figured out what the devices do. &#13;
&#13;
He suggests the team look for one more device.</string>
  <string id="11746">You&apos;ve found five Eggman devices, and Tails combined them into one machine! According to Tails, the machine is some kind of pattern generator.</string>
  <string id="11747">Strange Eggman Devices</string>
  <string id="11749">Sonic and friends saved a young boy from a giant scorpion!&#13;
&#13;
Take the boy home to his father, who lives in Emerald Town in Central City.</string>
  <string id="11750">The team heard a child screaming for help in a cave in Green Hill Zone. Maybe Sonic should help him!</string>
  <string id="11751">The young boy&apos;s father was so grateful to see his son, he gave Sonic a gift!</string>
  <string id="11752">A Young Boy in Trouble!</string>
  <string id="11753">Eggman will pay for what he has done!&#13;
&#13;
Tails rigged the communicators he found to detect Eggman&apos;s electronic signature. Now the team can track down and confront Eggman before he does any more serious damage.&#13;
&#13;
Sonic and his friends must explore Green Hill Zone, Central City, and Mystic Ruins to find Eggman signatures. If they find an Eggman signature, Eggman can&apos;t be far behind!</string>
  <string id="11761">Tails&apos; detector tracked an Eggman signature coming from a ruin in Green Hill Zone, but the way in was sealed. When the team unlocked the entrance, laser sentinels attacked! Eggman must be inside!&#13;
&#13;
The team must enter the ruin and defeat Eggman!</string>
  <string id="11762">Sonic and his friends found Eggman... who says he has reformed!&#13;
&#13;
But if Eggman isn&apos;t behind the evil deeds, who is? Should Sonic trust his nemesis to help find the true culprit?</string>
  <string id="11763">Egghunt</string>
  <string id="11764">Look, Sonic! It&apos;s another Eggman device. No wonder the old man couldn&apos;t get it to make coffee!</string>
  <string id="11765">Look, Sonic! It&apos;s another Eggman device. No wonder the old man couldn&apos;t get it to make coffee!</string>
  <string id="11766">Look, Sonic! The robot&apos;s head is another Eggman device. It must be old if it&apos;s forgotten its programming!</string>
  <string id="11767">Look, Sonic! The robot&apos;s head is another Eggman device. It must be old if it&apos;s forgotten its programming!</string>
  <string id="11770">Look, Sonic! It&apos;s another Eggman device. Maybe that&apos;s what set off those animals!</string>
  <string id="11771">Look, Sonic! It&apos;s another Eggman device. Maybe that&apos;s what set off those animals!</string>
  <string id="11780">These devices have a few things in common. Let&apos;s see if we can find a couple more.</string>
  <string id="11781">Strange... this device seems to interact with the other device we found! If we find more, maybe we can find out what they do!</string>
  <string id="11782">Hm. I can&apos;t tell what it&apos;s used for. Maybe I can examine it some other time. </string>
  <string id="11787">A Wolf in the Shadows</string>
  <string id="11788">It looks like another Eggman device!</string>
  <string id="11789">It looks like another Eggman device!</string>
  <string id="11790">It looks like an Eggman device!</string>
  <string id="11793">Look, Sonic! The robot&apos;s head is another Eggman device. It must be old if it forgot its programming!</string>
  <string id="11794">Look, Sonic! The robot&apos;s head is another Eggman device. It must be old if it forgot its programming!</string>
  <string id="11802">Whew! That was a close one!</string>
  <string id="11804">I hate to say it, but the repulsor field closed up behind us. I think we&apos;re stuck here.</string>
  <string id="11805">Oh, great. Mama always told me that one day I&apos;d get stuck in an alien dimension without a change of clothes.</string>
  <string id="11806">We have to stop Ix. And then, find a way home.</string>
  <string id="11807">But how do we--</string>
  <string id="11809">The island! It&apos;s moving!</string>
  <string id="11810">Lord Ix is using the power of the Master Emerald to move the Nocturne toward the wormhole!</string>
  <string id="11813">I don&apos;t think so! Hee hee hee hee!</string>
  <string id="11814">Who said that?</string>
  <string id="11816">The mighty Lord Ix has set his plan into motion! Your world will quiver in fear! Hee hee hee hee!</string>
  <string id="11817">And you, Shade, princess of traitors. Don&apos;t think Lord Ix has forgotten you. </string>
  <string id="11819">Come face us! If you dare! Hee hee hee hee!</string>
  <string id="11821">Who were they?</string>
  <string id="11822">Scylla and Charyb: the twin prefects of the Nocturnus Army. They must have the last two Chaos Emeralds.</string>
  <string id="11824">If we can get the last Chaos Emeralds from them, we should be able to stop the Nocturne before it reaches the wormhole.</string>
  <string id="11826">Let&apos;s split up. I&apos;ll take one team and go after Scylla. Sonic, your team can go after Charyb.</string>
  <string id="11827">I guess we&apos;re really doing this.</string>
  <string id="11828">Scylla&apos;s rock is to the northeast. Charyb&apos;s lair is to the northwest.</string>
  <string id="11829">Then we&apos;ll go northeast. </string>
  <string id="11830">Be careful, team!</string>
  <string id="11831">We don&apos;t have time to argue! There&apos;s no other way we can get both Emeralds before Nocturne reaches the wormhole!</string>
  <string id="11832">Sonic!</string>
  <string id="11833">You dare accuse me of being a traitor?!</string>
  <string id="11834">Maybe I think Ix can be redeemed. Maybe I want to see my people returned to the world.</string>
  <string id="11835">But not like this. I want family and friends, not a conquering army.</string>
  <string id="11837">Whatever. I have a job to do.</string>
  <string id="11838">Not much. A lot has changed even since I left to go to your world.</string>
  <string id="11839">But I will say this: Do not underestimate Scylla and Charyb. They are Lord Ix&apos;s most prized warriors, more than a match for any number of Nocturnus soldiers. </string>
  <string id="11840">And they know we&apos;re coming. There&apos;s no telling what sorts of traps and tests they have devised.</string>
  <string id="11889">We can do it!</string>
  <string id="11903">Sounds good. Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="11908">I&apos;m not sure this is such a good idea.</string>
  <string id="11909">Knuckles... Are you sure you&apos;re not trying to help Ix?</string>
  <string id="11913">I&apos;m keeping an eye on you, Knuckles.</string>
  <string id="11915">After you.</string>
  <string id="11916">Shade, do you have any advice about this place?</string>
  <string id="11919">Well, let&apos;s get started, then.</string>
  <string id="11963">Okay. We&apos;re very close to Scylla&apos;s rock. We should be careful. Scylla is very tricky.</string>
  <string id="11964">Hee hee hee!</string>
  <string id="11965">Scylla! Come out and fight!</string>
  <string id="11966">Patience, my pugnacious porcupine! Always in such a hurry to be defeated!</string>
  <string id="11967">Porcupine?</string>
  <string id="11968">Well... I mean, with the spines, and the.... Who cares?</string>
  <string id="11969">Why not savor your defeat? Stop and soak in the pain!</string>
  <string id="11970">You&apos;ve always been a madman, Scylla!</string>
  <string id="11971">Madman! Hee hee hee!</string>
  <string id="11972">Foolish Shade, I am not a man!</string>
  <string id="11974">I am your destroyer! Hee hee hee hee hee!</string>
  <string id="11975">Come on! Let&apos;s see what you&apos;ve got!</string>
  <string id="11976">Scylla lives on a rocky outcropping above us. He&apos;ll be heavily defended. We have to be careful.</string>
  <string id="11977">Right. Let&apos;s keep moving.</string>
  <string id="11993">Hold on, team.</string>
  <string id="11994">Come in, Shade. This is Sonic.</string>
  <string id="11995">Sonic, we&apos;ve run into some trouble. We need your help.</string>
  <string id="11996">What&apos;s wrong?</string>
  <string id="11997">We&apos;ve got a laser turret here. We can&apos;t get by it.</string>
  <string id="11998">There should be some Zoah and Kron fighters in orbit around the Nocturne, but they can&apos;t get in because of the repulsor field!</string>
  <string id="11999">The shutdown for the repulsor field should be near you. If you can find the controls, you can bring down the repulsor field!</string>
  <string id="12000">We&apos;ll see what we can do. Sonic out!</string>
  <string id="12001">I don&apos;t trust that Shade. I bet she&apos;s trying to turn Knuckles against us.</string>
  <string id="12003">You heard Shade, team. Let&apos;s get it done!</string>
  <string id="12015">Sonic! We&apos;re done for if we don&apos;t find a way to get rid of this water!</string>
  <string id="12016">That&apos;s close enough. I can&apos;t let you take the Emerald.</string>
  <string id="12017">Out of our way, Charyb, or we&apos;ll go through you.</string>
  <string id="12018">You&apos;re out of your element, Sonic the Hedgehog. Down here, I am invincible!</string>
  <string id="12019">Sonic, he&apos;s right! If we can&apos;t beat him, we&apos;ll drown!</string>
  <string id="12020">We have to do our best. We can do this!</string>
  <string id="12021">Okay, Charyb! Let&apos;s see what you&apos;ve got!</string>
  <string id="12026">Sonic! Quick! There&apos;s a pocket of air!</string>
  <string id="12027">We can use these to breathe! Maybe we won&apos;t drown down here, after all!</string>
  <string id="12030">You&apos;ve done well to make it this far, Sonic the Hedgehog. I&apos;m rather impressed.</string>
  <string id="12031">Charyb!</string>
  <string id="12032">But you&apos;ve entered my lair now. I&apos;m afraid you&apos;ll have to fight on my terms.</string>
  <string id="12034">Sonic! He&apos;s flooding the corridor! This is horrible!</string>
  <string id="12035">Shh! I need to think!</string>
  <string id="12036">Tails calling Knuckles! Come in, Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="12037">*ksshhh* I&apos;m a little busy right now, Tails!</string>
  <string id="12038">We&apos;ll get through this, Tails. Come on!</string>
  <string id="12039">Sonic, I&apos;m picking up powerful energy fluctuations ahead. We must be on the right track!</string>
  <string id="12040">Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="12042">Here goes nothing!</string>
  <string id="12044">It worked! I took down the shielding!</string>
  <string id="12045">Tails calling Knuckles! Come in, Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="12046">What... Did you...?</string>
  <string id="12047">Tune your wrist communicator to alert frequency! And cover your ears!</string>
  <string id="12048">I... I&apos;ll try....</string>
  <string id="12049">So now I set this to broadcast, and I up the amplitude... a little tuning there....</string>
  <string id="12051">I think that did it!</string>
  <string id="12052">They shimmered a moment, and then stopped! I think it worked!</string>
  <string id="12053">Good luck, Knuckles! Tails out!</string>
  <string id="12054">This Gizoid seems different. Hmm....</string>
  <string id="12055">It&apos;s a kind of sonic frequency! That&apos;s it! If I can attune the... and then....</string>
  <string id="12056">What is it?</string>
  <string id="12058">Yes! I think I got it! Now to test it one more time, just to be sure.</string>
  <string id="12059">Let&apos;s find one more Gizoid!</string>
  <string id="12060">Another Gizoid. Hmm....</string>
  <string id="12061">It&apos;s a sort of forcefield, but it&apos;s not like the repulsor field outside. Some sort of invisible wavelength?</string>
  <string id="12062">Figured it out?</string>
  <string id="12063">Not yet, but I think I have some ideas. Let&apos;s keep looking!</string>
  <string id="12064">A Gizoid Centurion! If I can take a moment to....</string>
  <string id="12065">Yes! It seems as if they have some type of shielding around them. No wonder Knuckles couldn&apos;t hurt them!</string>
  <string id="12066">Let&apos;s keep looking. I think we can help them!</string>
  <string id="12067">Look, Sonic! A Gizoid! I think it&apos;s one of those Gizoid Centurions Knuckles mentioned!</string>
  <string id="12068">Hmph. That thing doesn&apos;t look so tough.</string>
  <string id="12069">If I can study a few of these inactive Gizoids, maybe I can come up with a way to help Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="12070">Let&apos;s look around. There have to be more inactive Gizoids around!</string>
  <string id="12071">We haven&apos;t heard from Knuckles in a while. I hope he&apos;s okay.</string>
  <string id="12072">Ugh... Sonic... Come in...</string>
  <string id="12073">Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="12074">Gizoid... Centurions... we can&apos;t fight them... too strong....</string>
  <string id="12075">Knuckles ran into more trouble, huh?</string>
  <string id="12076">We have to help! Be on the lookout for anything that might help Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="12078">We&apos;re getting closer. I can feel it!</string>
  <string id="12079">Keep your eyes open, team. Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="12080">There&apos;s the switch!</string>
  <string id="12082">Sounds like that did it!</string>
  <string id="12083">Let&apos;s keep moving, team. Charyb&apos;s still out there!</string>
  <string id="12084">Right!</string>
  <string id="12089">We made it!</string>
  <string id="12090">Take a breather, team. We have a lot of work to do.</string>
  <string id="12091">I wonder how Knuckles is doing.</string>
  <string id="12092">A switch! Maybe that will open the door Charyb ran through!</string>
  <string id="12093">Rats! Still locked! There has to be a switch somewhere. We need to find it!</string>
  <string id="12094">I hope the others will be all right!</string>
  <string id="12095">I guess we&apos;d better get moving!</string>
  <string id="12096">Sonic the Hedgehog. I knew you were coming.</string>
  <string id="12097">It&apos;s Charyb!</string>
  <string id="12098">You&apos;re too late. I have a Chaos Emerald of my own. Even if you could find me, you&apos;ll never get it from me.</string>
  <string id="12099">Quit hiding and bring it on, Charyb!</string>
  <string id="12100">Patience, Sonic. That time will come. But first, I want to see you dance.</string>
  <string id="12102">Ha ha ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="12103">He&apos;s triggered an alarm! What&apos;ll we do?</string>
  <string id="12104">Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="12193">We&apos;d better release that valve quickly or Sonic is done for!</string>
  <string id="12194">It should be right through that door.</string>
  <string id="12195">I had no doubt we could do it. </string>
  <string id="12196">The valve control for Charyb&apos;s lair should be through that door over there.</string>
  <string id="12198">I haven&apos;t knocked out an echidna in ages! This ought to be fun! Hee hee hee!</string>
  <string id="12199">Don&apos;t waste my time, Scylla! Come and fight me!</string>
  <string id="12200">Hee hee hee! As you wish!</string>
  <string id="12201">Everyone all right?</string>
  <string id="12202">We did it.</string>
  <string id="12203">We did.</string>
  <string id="12204">We&apos;re very close to Scylla&apos;s lair. We have to press on.</string>
  <string id="12205">Right. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="12206">That ought to even things out some.</string>
  <string id="12207">Impossible! How did you remove our shields?</string>
  <string id="12208">It&apos;s called teamwork. Try it sometime.</string>
  <string id="12209">Even if you get past us, you have an army of Gizoid Centurions ready to stop you.</string>
  <string id="12210">Then I guess we&apos;d better get started.</string>
  <string id="12213">Ngh... No... I....</string>
  <string id="12217">Gizoid Centurions! Lord Ix must really want us stopped.</string>
  <string id="12218">Gizoid Centurions?</string>
  <string id="12219">Gizoid Centurions are the elite guards of the Nocturne. They are advanced Gizoids. Far stronger than the run-of-the-mill Gizoids.</string>
  <string id="12220">We have to get past them. There&apos;s no other option.</string>
  <string id="12221">We have to fight!</string>
  <string id="12223">That did it. Let&apos;s move!</string>
  <string id="12224">Hold on to me! We have to fly!</string>
  <string id="12226">Sentry turrets! We have to get past them!</string>
  <string id="12227">I have an idea.</string>
  <string id="12228">Sonic! Sonic, this is Shade. Come in!</string>
  <string id="12229">Keep moving! We have to find Scylla!</string>
  <string id="12230">Knuckles, Why did you split up the team back there? We could have stolen the Chaos Emeralds and stopped Ix with plenty of time to spare!</string>
  <string id="12235">You don&apos;t get it. No one does.</string>
  <string id="12236">Ix isn&apos;t just some villain. He is an echidna like you and me.</string>
  <string id="12237">If we can talk some sense into him, he can help you and the others return to our world! And I won&apos;t be the last. Not anymore.</string>
  <string id="12239">Knuckles....</string>
  <string id="12240">Sonic wants to rush in there, spines flashing, and bring Ix down. He can&apos;t see anything but the bad in Ix.</string>
  <string id="12242">Knuckles... Lord Ix can&apos;t be reasoned with. He&apos;s gone mad over our time in the Twilight Cage. You can&apos;t--</string>
  <string id="12243">I can&apos;t just give up on him. If there&apos;s even a chance he can be redeemed....</string>
  <string id="12244">But we have to get there before Sonic does. Otherwise, we won&apos;t even have the chance to try.</string>
  <string id="12245">I see. Then we&apos;d best get moving.</string>
  <string id="12246">Thank you. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="12301">Whew! We&apos;re safe!</string>
  <string id="12302">Good flying, Tails!</string>
  <string id="12303">Thanks. I knew we would make it.</string>
  <string id="12304">Hey...</string>
  <string id="12305">Yeah?</string>
  <string id="12306"> We did it! We stopped Ix!</string>
  <string id="12307">Yeah. Yeah, we did.</string>
  <string id="12308">I&apos;m sorry, Knuckles. If we could have found a way....</string>
  <string id="12309">It&apos;s okay. If there&apos;s a way, we&apos;ll find it.</string>
  <string id="12311">Good work, team. We really did save the world this time.</string>
  <string id="12312">We&apos;re going home!</string>
  <string id="12313">Uh, Sonic?</string>
  <string id="12314">What is it, Tails?</string>
  <string id="12315">Shouldn&apos;t there be, you know, ground beneath us?</string>
  <string id="12316">What?!</string>
  <string id="12318">What&apos;s going on here?</string>
  <string id="12320">What was that? </string>
  <string id="12321">Someone&apos;s firing at us!</string>
  <string id="12322">We&apos;re hit! We&apos;re going down!</string>
  <string id="12323">Brace yourselves!</string>
  <string id="12327">Is everyone all right?</string>
  <string id="12328">Where are we?</string>
  <string id="12329">Look alive, team!</string>
  <string id="12331">Aw, man....</string>
  <string id="12366">No! It can&apos;t be!</string>
  <string id="12367">Not yet, Sonic the Hedgehog. This old man still has one more trick!</string>
  <string id="12372">Fools! You dare defy me, Lord Ix?! I who led the Nocturnus into world domination and united the warring peoples of the Twilight Cage?</string>
  <string id="12373">No... I&apos;d say that was Sonic who did that....</string>
  <string id="12374">Silence!</string>
  <string id="12375">Motes of dust! Meaningless flies! I will wipe you from the face of this dimension!</string>
  <string id="12376">Something around here needs wiping!</string>
  <string id="12377">Who...?</string>
  <string id="12380">I never meant for it to come to this.</string>
  <string id="12381">Well, it&apos;s too late for regrets, Ix. </string>
  <string id="12382">Oh, it&apos;s long past too late. </string>
  <string id="12386">The Kron? The Voxai? All the others?</string>
  <string id="12387">I managed to unite them all under my leadership with the promise that one day, we all would be free.</string>
  <string id="12388">My echidna brother, you have lived many years alone, knowing that your people were lost to time.</string>
  <string id="12389">But here I have the power to return them to you, to give you a family once more! I can return the echidnas to the place of power they deserve!</string>
  <string id="12391">You have a point.</string>
  <string id="12393">Yes! My friend, you must understand where your friend Sonic does not! I have only the best of intentions. I work to reunite you with your people!</string>
  <string id="12396">Join me. Join me, and free your people from imprisonment!</string>
  <string id="12398">I...</string>
  <string id="12399">I don&apos;t think so.</string>
  <string id="12400">What?!</string>
  <string id="12401">You stole the Master Emerald. Maybe you forgot that the Master Emerald had a guardian.</string>
  <string id="12403">I swore to keep the Master Emerald safe from maniacs like you.</string>
  <string id="12404">If there is a way to save Shade&apos;s clan, then I will find it. But you don&apos;t get to keep the Master Emerald. It&apos;s not yours to have.</string>
  <string id="12405">Then you have chosen your path. </string>
  <string id="12406">I have. </string>
  <string id="12407">And you will die.</string>
  <string id="12408">I&apos;m afraid so, Ix. It&apos;s over.</string>
  <string id="12449">Everyone make it aboard?</string>
  <string id="12450">We&apos;re all here. </string>
  <string id="12451">Brilliant, Tails! I didn&apos;t know the Cyclone could do that!</string>
  <string id="12452">Hey, Eggman and I designed this ship ourselves! She&apos;ll surprise you!</string>
  <string id="12453">Well done!</string>
  <string id="12454"> Yay!</string>
  <string id="12455">And we stopped Ix! Our world is saved! </string>
  <string id="12456">Yeah, now we just have to get back there. </string>
  <string id="12457">Everyone hang on. I&apos;m working on that!</string>
  <string id="12459">A dead end!</string>
  <string id="12460">I&apos;m not so sure. Look!</string>
  <string id="12462">Knuckles! And he&apos;s talking to Ix!</string>
  <string id="12466">An elevator! Maybe this leads up to Ix&apos;s chamber!</string>
  <string id="12467">Then what are we waiting for?</string>
  <string id="12468">Knuckles, this is Tails! Come in, Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="12469">Oh no! They&apos;re not answering! Sonic, they could be in trouble!</string>
  <string id="12470">Right! Let&apos;s hurry!</string>
  <string id="12471">Well, yes. But what if something is jamming the communicator?</string>
  <string id="12472">They could be in real danger!</string>
  <string id="12473">But... I... I guess. Once we stop Ix, we can go look for Knuckles.</string>
  <string id="12474">If that&apos;s the case, we have to hurry! Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="12475">We did it!</string>
  <string id="12476">And there&apos;s the Chaos Emerald!</string>
  <string id="12477">Knuckles, this is Sonic. We got the Chaos Emerald.</string>
  <string id="12478">You took down Charyb?</string>
  <string id="12479">Yeah. Consider him beached.</string>
  <string id="12500">Then let&apos;s go find them.</string>
  <string id="12502">If Knuckles was in danger, wouldn&apos;t he have called us?</string>
  <string id="12504">Knuckles can take care of himself. We have to find Ix!</string>
  <string id="12511">It&apos;s over, Ix. You&apos;ve lost.</string>
  <string id="12512">Yes, you have defeated me. You have won the day. </string>
  <string id="12513">But if I can&apos;t leave this nightmare prison... then neither will you!</string>
  <string id="12515">Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!</string>
  <string id="12517">What did he do?</string>
  <string id="12518">What&apos;s happening?</string>
  <string id="12520">Lord Ix activated the shutdown sequence! He&apos;s closing the wormhole!</string>
  <string id="12521">Everyone! Grab hold of something!</string>
  <string id="12522">Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="12524">What do we do? We&apos;re doomed!</string>
  <string id="12525">Maybe not!</string>
  <string id="12527">Our ride&apos;s here!</string>
  <string id="12528">Everyone! To the Cyclone!</string>
  <string id="12530">Hold it, Ix!</string>
  <string id="12531">You think you&apos;ve won... you think you&apos;ve defeated me....</string>
  <string id="12532">Look at you. You can hardly walk. End this now, Ix.</string>
  <string id="12533">Never!</string>
  <string id="12557">Where... are we...</string>
  <string id="12559">Shh! Quiet! He hasn&apos;t noticed us yet!</string>
  <string id="12560">Ha ha ha. No such luck, my precious friends.</string>
  <string id="12561">Ix!</string>
  <string id="12562">I would like to welcome you to my chambers. You&apos;ve come a long way.</string>
  <string id="12563">We have the Chaos Emeralds, Ix. There&apos;s no more you can do.</string>
  <string id="12564">Then please. Have a seat.</string>
  <string id="12565">Let us talk a moment, yes?</string>
  <string id="12575">This is useless! There are no exits here!</string>
  <string id="12576">But I remember it was here! It was right here!</string>
  <string id="12577">They must have changed things around. They must have--</string>
  <string id="12579">Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="12581">So Scylla and Charyb are both down, and we&apos;ve recovered both of their Chaos Emeralds.</string>
  <string id="12582">That means the Nocturne should....</string>
  <string id="12584">You were right, Shade. We&apos;ve stopped moving.</string>
  <string id="12585">There should be an entrance to Lord Ix&apos;s chamber nearby.</string>
  <string id="12586">Then let&apos;s look around. We have to hurry.</string>
  <string id="12599">Lay down your arms, heroes. You have no chance.</string>
  <string id="12600">Stop blubbering and bring it on, Charyb!</string>
  <string id="12601">Sonic, Knuckles here. Everything okay there?</string>
  <string id="12602">We&apos;re here with Charyb, Knuckles. We&apos;re a little busy.</string>
  <string id="12603">We&apos;ve defeated Scylla. There&apos;s a valve here that should drain the water from Charyb&apos;s lair.</string>
  <string id="12604">Who&apos;s that? Is that one of your little friends?</string>
  <string id="12605">Shh! I&apos;m talking here.</string>
  <string id="12621">Has Eggman really reformed?&#13;
&#13;
Sonic and friends have no choice but to trust him if they want to find Angel Island and stop the Marauders. Eggman tracked Angel Island and discovered it was heading for the sky over Metropolis, Eggman&apos;s old headquarters. </string>
  <string id="12622">Has Eggman really reformed?&#13;
&#13;
Sonic and friends have no choice but to trust him if they want to find Angel Island and stop the Marauders. Eggman tracked Angel Island and discovered it was heading for the sky over Metropolis, Eggman&apos;s old headquarters.&#13;
&#13;
Eggman and Tails are preparing the Tornado for a long-distance flight to the Blue Ridge Zone. Sonic should activate the Tornado outside when he&apos;s ready to go to Blue Ridge Zone.</string>
  <string id="12623">Has Eggman really reformed?&#13;
&#13;
Sonic and friends have no choice but to trust him if they want to find Angel Island and stop the Marauders. Eggman tracked Angel Island and discovered it was heading for the sky over Metropolis, Eggman&apos;s old headquarters. &#13;
&#13;
The team has landed in Blue Ridge Zone. Sonic and friends must go north to Metropolis and get inside Eggman&apos;s ruined headquarters.</string>
  <string id="12626">As the team approached Metropolis, Marauders ambushed them! The Marauders were led by a girl named Shade, an echidna of the mysterious Nocturnus Clan. Knuckles is not the last echidna, as he thought!&#13;
&#13;
The Marauders have destroyed the entrance to Metropolis! Luckily, Eggman knows a secret way into his old fortress: an abandoned subway tunnel to the west of the Metropolis entrance in Blue Ridge Zone.</string>
  <string id="12627">Thanks to Eggman, Sonic and the team found an abandoned subway tunnel and are inside the ruins of Metropolis. &#13;
&#13;
Now the assault against the Nocturnus Clan begins!</string>
  <string id="12633">Sonic and friends reached the Metropolis Underground, Eggman&apos;s secret base under his old fortress. From here, they will stage their attack on the evil Nocturnus Clan in the city above.&#13;
&#13;
As they prepare, Sonic can speak with his team. Tails noticed that Knuckles seemed unhappy.&#13;
&#13;
Sonic should let Tails know when everyone is ready.</string>
  <string id="12636">The assault on the Nocturnus Clan has begun! The team splits up: Sonic and Knuckles lead one group, and Tails and Eggman lead another.&#13;
&#13;
Sonic and Knuckles&apos; team must escape the Underground and get to the surface to clear the way for Tails and Eggman&apos;s team.</string>
  <string id="12637">The assault on the Nocturnus Clan has begun! The team splits up: Sonic and Knuckles lead one group, and Tails and Eggman lead another.&#13;
&#13;
Sonic and Knuckles&apos; team found a way out of the Underground! Now they must leave the tunnels.</string>
  <string id="12640">The assault on the Nocturnus Clan has begun! The team splits up: Sonic and Knuckles lead one group, and Tails and Eggman lead another.&#13;
&#13;
Tails and Eggman must find Eggman&apos;s old weapons lab. A weapon there will help them fight the Nocturnus Clan! &#13;
&#13;
But for now, they must get through the ruined tunnels....</string>
  <string id="12641">The assault on the Nocturnus Clan has begun! The team splits up: Sonic and Knuckles lead one group, and Tails and Eggman lead another.&#13;
&#13;
Tails and Eggman have found part of Eggman&apos;s old weapon. If they can find one more piece, Eggman can make a weapon to fight the Nocturnus Clan.</string>
  <string id="12643">The assault on the Nocturnus Clan has begun! The team splits up: Sonic and Knuckles lead one group, and Tails and Eggman lead another.&#13;
&#13;
When they left the Underground, Sonic and Knuckles noticed airships rising from an airbase in the east. The team must reach that airbase and stop the Nocturnus Clan before the evil Marauders reach Angel Island!</string>
  <string id="12644">The assault on the Nocturnus Clan has begun! The team splits up: Sonic and Knuckles lead one group, and Tails and Eggman lead another.&#13;
&#13;
Sonic and Knuckles&apos; team reached the airbase, but the Nocturnus Clan was already leaving for Angel Island! Sonic and Knuckles must get inside!</string>
  <string id="12645">The assault on the Nocturnus Clan has begun! The team split up: Sonic and Knuckles lead one group, and Tails and Eggman lead another.&#13;
&#13;
Sonic and Knuckles&apos; team reached the airbase, but the Nocturnus Clan is already leaving for Angel Island! Sonic and Knuckles must sneak onto one of the airships before it&apos;s too late!</string>
  <string id="12648">The assault on the Nocturnus Clan has begun! The team splits up: Sonic and Knuckles lead one group, and Tails and Eggman lead another.&#13;
&#13;
Tails and Eggman&apos;s team heard the airships taking off, and Sonic radioed to tell them that the surface is clear. They must find the exit and leave the Underground!</string>
  <string id="12649">The assault on the Nocturnus Clan has begun! The team splits up: Sonic and Knuckles lead one group, and Tails and Eggman lead another.&#13;
&#13;
Tails and Eggman left the Underground and emerged in Metropolis. With the Marauders leaving to invade Angel Island, the streets were clear for Tails and Eggman to search for the other piece of Eggman&apos;s weapon!</string>
  <string id="12650">The assault on the Nocturnus Clan has begun! The team splits up: Sonic and Knuckles lead one group, and Tails and Eggman lead another.&#13;
&#13;
Eggman found the last part needed to build his mighty weapon. The team must get to Eggman&apos;s old weapons lab and create the weapon that will stop the Nocturnus Clan!</string>
  <string id="12652">The assault on the Nocturnus Clan has begun! The team splits up: Sonic and Knuckles lead one group, and Tails and Eggman lead another.&#13;
&#13;
The team found Eggman&apos;s weapon. With all the parts, Eggman and Tails started building a weapon to banish the Nocturnus Clan once and for all!</string>
  <string id="12653">The assault on the Nocturnus Clan has begun! The team splits up: Sonic and Knuckles lead one group, and Tails and Eggman lead another.&#13;
&#13;
Sonic and his team stowed away on a Nocturnus Clan airship. They must fight their way to the bridge and take control!</string>
  <string id="12654">The assault on the Nocturnus Clan has begun! The team splits up: Sonic and Knuckles lead one group, and Tails and Eggman lead another.&#13;
&#13;
Sonic and Knuckles led their team to the bridge and defeated the airship&apos;s captain, but Nocturnus Clan boarding parties landed on the airship! The team must defeat the sky-raiders!</string>
  <string id="12656">The assault on the Nocturnus Clan has begun! The team splits up: Sonic and Knuckles lead one group, and Tails and Eggman lead another.&#13;
&#13;
Nocturnus Clan sky-raiders destroyed the airship&apos;s anti-aircraft cannon! Sonic called Tails for help.</string>
  <string id="12657">The assault on the Nocturnus Clan has begun! The team splits up: Sonic and Knuckles lead one group, and Tails and Eggman lead another.&#13;
&#13;
Tails and Eggman completed the Beam Cannon, but Sonic is in trouble! Eggman once controlled a massive anti-aircraft cannon in Metropolis. If Tails and Eggman find that cannon, they can help Sonic and his team! Maybe there is a path available from the top of the escalator.</string>
  <string id="12660">The assault on the Nocturnus Clan has begun! The team splits up: Sonic and Knuckles lead one group, and Tails and Eggman lead another.&#13;
&#13;
Tails and Eggman reached the anti-aircraft cannon, but it was protected by a guardian robot! The two geniuses destroyed the robot, so now they can repair the cannon and clear the skies for Sonic and Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="12661">The assault on the Nocturnus Clan has begun! The team splits up: Sonic and Knuckles lead one group, and Tails and Eggman lead another.&#13;
&#13;
Thanks to Tails and Eggman&apos;s quick work, Sonic&apos;s team landed safely on Angel Island. But now they face the mighty assembled Nocturnus Clan!&#13;
&#13;
With Tails and Eggman&apos;s help a few minutes away, Sonic and Knuckles must occupy the Nocturnus Clan so they don&apos;t take the Master Emerald before the rest of the team can arrive with the Beam Cannon!</string>
  <string id="12662">The assault on the Nocturnus Clan has begun! The team splits up: Sonic and Knuckles lead one group, and Tails and Eggman lead another.&#13;
&#13;
Sonic, Knuckles, and team battled the Nocturnus Clan, including their mysterious leader, Lord Ix! Now they must keep the Clan busy so Tails and Eggman can find a way to reach Angel Island... and bring the Beam Cannon with them!</string>
  <string id="12663">The assault on the Nocturnus Clan has begun! The team splits up: Sonic and Knuckles lead one group, and Tails and Eggman lead another.&#13;
&#13;
Sonic, Knuckles, and team were fighting for their lives on Angel Island and called for help! The teleporter in Eggman&apos;s Underground base can be reconfigured to send the team to Angel Island... but they must get back there and make it work!</string>
  <string id="12666">Sonic and his friends reunited to defeat Lord Ix, but at the end of the fight, Ix unleashed a terrifying power blast and ran towards the Master Emerald. Before the team could react, the Master Emerald was gone!&#13;
&#13;
Without the Master Emerald&apos;s power to keep it aloft, Angel Island crashed down into Metropolis!&#13;
&#13;
Things don&apos;t look good for our heroes!</string>
  <string id="12667">The Battle for Angel Island</string>
  <string id="12674">What do you want, Sonic?</string>
  <string id="12677">Norton is Missing!</string>
  <string id="12686">Good luck, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="12705">Look out!</string>
  <string id="12706">You&apos;re not fighting alone anymore, Sonic! I can help you!</string>
  <string id="12707">You need to choose commands for everyone in your team at the same time. Keep choosing commands until everyone is out of actions!</string>
  <string id="12708">Once that&apos;s done, everyone will perform their actions at the same time. Sit back and enjoy the show!</string>

  <string id="12721">Angel Island has fallen from the sky, and now a giant wormhole threatens to blot out the sun over Metropolis! Our heroes&apos; only hope is to go into the wormhole to recover the Chaos Emeralds and the Master Emerald from the evil Ix!&#13;
&#13;
Eggman has a rocket ship that could get our heroes up to the wormhole, but the Angel Island crash knocked out power all over Metropolis. Sonic must lead a team to find and recharge three generators and supply power to Eggman&apos;s lab!&#13;
&#13;
Of course, with him is the ex-leader of the Marauders, Shade the Echidna. Has she really changed, or is this another part of Ix&apos;s evil plan?</string>

&#13;
Sonic and his team were able to restore power to Eggman&apos;s lab, enabling Eggman and Tails to begin work on a rocket that can travel through the wormhole. Of course, before the rocket can survive travel to another dimension, Eggman and Tails must install a dimensional buffer. Eggman has one hidden away in his Hazard Vault. Since the dangerous inhabitants of the Hazard Vault have already escaped, it should be an easy task to go inside and find the part.</string>

Eggman has a rocket ship that could get our heroes up to the wormhole. Of course, before the rocket can survive travel to another dimension, Eggman and Tails must install a dimensional buffer.

The Kron leader, Foreman Krag, says that the Nocturnus Clan has taken over their factory, and forbade the Kron to enter. Foreman Krag has asked Sonic and friends to find a way inside the factory and shut down the forcefield that keeps the Kron outside. In return, the team can keep the strange crystal the Nocturnus gave to the Kron.&#13;

Sector Scylla is home to the slime-race known as the N&apos;rrgal and a race of militaristic giants known as the Zoah.

It looks like the team will have to find a way to remove them without forcing open war against the N&apos;rrgal!&#13;

A N&apos;rrgal swarm appeared to speak with the team, believing them to be spies for the Zoah. It seems the N&apos;rrgal Queen wants to speak with Sonic and his friends. If the team refuses, they will face the entire might of the N&apos;rrgal race!</string>

Sonic receives a call from Shade: Knuckles&apos; team is in trouble! Sonic and his team must find the shutdown switch for the repulsor field so Zoah and Kron starfighters can swoop in and take out the laser turrets that are blocking Knuckles&apos; way.</string>
  <string id="12985">Thanks to a little help from their new friends, the team has landed on Nocturnus, just before Ix used the power of the Chaos Emeralds to start moving Nocturne toward the wormhole. Moments later, they were met with holoprojections of Ix&apos;s most prized warriors: the psychotic Scylla and the cold-hearted Charyb! &#13;

&#13;
Knuckles and Shade must lead their team to track down Scylla and take his Chaos Emerald before the Nocturne travels through the wormhole and into their world! Knuckles has another interesting motive for splitting up the team: He wants to try to talk Ix into abandoning his evil plan! Knuckles must reach Ix before Sonic does!</string>

As Sonic and his team entered Charyb&apos;s lair, water began rushing in from outside, flooding the corridor! Now the team must fight their way to Charyb without drowning first!&#13;

Now that he&apos;s free, the team must get to Angel Island quickly to stop the Marauders from stealing the Master Emerald!</string>
  <string id="13051">Hm. I think I have an idea what we can do with these devices. Let&apos;s look around for more.</string>
  <string id="13052">These devices have a few things in common. Let&apos;s see if we can find a couple more.</string>

The boy returned to his family safely.</string>
  <string id="13075">Sonic told the Swatbot that its duties were complete, so the Swatbot deactivated itself in peace.</string>
  <string id="13076">A device in a Central City shop set off Tails&apos; Eggman tracker. A shady salesman named Sal told the store&apos;s shopkeeper the device was a coffee machine and traded it for the shopkeeper&apos;s own prized stapler. But the machine doesn&apos;t make coffee, and the shopkeeper feels cheated.&#13;
&#13;
Sonic returned the shopkeeper&apos;s stapler, and the shopkeeper gave him the &quot;coffee machine&quot;... which is really an Eggman device!</string>
  <string id="13082">Here we are again. And the tunnel is still here! A marvel of engineering!</string>
  <string id="13083">Shall we go inside and put an end to these Marauders?</string>
  <string id="13084">If there&apos;s anything you want to do outside of Metropolis, I suggest you go and do it now. Once we&apos;re inside, there&apos;s no coming back.</string>
  <string id="13085">Come on! They&apos;re crawling all over my city!</string>
  <string id="13086">Hmph. Very well. Go and do your little side quests. I suppose Metropolis will still be ruined when we get back.</string>
  <string id="13087">We have a little time, but not much. When we&apos;re ready to stop the Marauders, we should come back here.</string>
  <string id="13088">Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="13090">Yes. We&apos;re done with everything out here.</string>
  <string id="13091">Let&apos;s go. I&apos;m done with everything out here.</string>
  <string id="13092">I have a few things I want to do first. </string>
  <string id="13097">Sonic and friends reached the abandoned tunnels leading to the ruined fortress in Metropolis, but Sonic wanted to finish things outside Metropolis first. &#13;
&#13;
To enter Metropolis and begin the quest to save Angel Island, return to Blue Ridge Zone and enter the abandoned tunnel.</string>
  <string id="13099">Tails! Get up here now!</string>
  <string id="13101">Tails launched and piloted the Cyclone through the wormhole and into the Twilight Cage, a mysterious dimension. Moments later, the Cyclone lost power. Tails was forced to crash-land on a strange planetoid: the stone-like Kron&apos;s homeworld!&#13;
&#13;
The Kron leader, Foreman Krag, says that the Nocturnus Clan has taken over their factory, and forbade the Kron to enter. Now that the team has shut down the generator, the Kron are free to enter the factory and retake it from the Nocturnus Clan! &#13;
&#13;
To get the Chaos Emerald, the team will have to find it. They must charge through a raging battle to get deeper into the upper levels of the factory!</string>
  <string id="13103">The team has recovered one of the Chaos Emeralds, but they have a long way to go to recover all seven and the Master Emerald. Tails&apos; sensors have detected Chaos Emeralds from Sectors Scylla and Charyb, as well as Ix&apos;s fortress, Nocturne. Unfortunately, a repulsor field surrounds Nocturne, so it&apos;s impossible to land anywhere near it.&#13;
&#13;
Sector Scylla is home to the slime-race known as the N&apos;rrgal and a race of militaristic giants known as the Zoah. Locked in a state of constant cold war, the two races are both hardened by battle and fiercely loyal to Ix. Upon landing on the N&apos;rrgal colony, the Cyclone was attacked by N&apos;rrgal workers who began absorbing energy from the ship. It looks like the team will have to find a way to remove them without forcing open war against the N&apos;rrgal!&#13;
&#13;
Of course, the team ended up fighting the N&apos;rrgal, and now the whole race is hostile!</string>

  <string id="13110">The Chaos Emeralds are powerful gems, Sonic. Someone who knows how to use them could do just about anything with their power!</string>
  <string id="13111">Remember when you had all seven Chaos Emeralds? You used their power to become Super Sonic! You were pretty much unbeatable!</string>
  <string id="13112">Without knowing who the Marauders are, there&apos;s no telling what they&apos;ll do with the Chaos Emeralds. We have to stop them!</string>

  <string id="13115">I remember. Good times.</string>
  <string id="13120">(The voices! I can hear them again!)</string>
  <string id="13121">(But they sound... different. I hear harsh commands where I once heard gentle suggestions.)</string>
  <string id="13122">(You have saved my family from the unbearable silence!)</string>
  <string id="13125">(I can&apos;t... I can&apos;t hear the voices....)</string>
  <string id="13126">(My name is Croesus. I can&apos;t... I can&apos;t hear the Overmind!)</string>
  <string id="13127">(Their voices... giving me purpose. My family and I have all lost their voices!)</string>
  <string id="13128">(Thebes... Did something happen? Why would Thebes help us?)</string>
  <string id="13129">(No. It&apos;s not the same. The others have become outerminds. I hear nothing but static in my mind, as if our minds were... jammed.)</string>
  <string id="13130">(We... I hear nothing but static in my mind. As if the Overmind&apos;s signals were being jammed.)</string>
  <string id="13131">(We saw Nocturnus scouts skulking around the colony, but we were distracted. We didn&apos;t think to wonder what they were doing!)</string>
  <string id="13132">(We are not outerminds. We are Voxai! But this silence... it&apos;s unbearable!)</string>
  <string id="13133">(Thank you! Oh, to think that it would fall to outerminds to save the thoughts of a Voxai!)</string>
  <string id="13134">(Hm. Let me ask them... oh. I can&apos;t. I don&apos;t know, and I can&apos;t get the answer!)</string>
  <string id="13135">(I-- I don&apos;t know. I just know that we can&apos;t hear the Overmind think. It&apos;s... horrible!)</string>
  <string id="13136">(Questions.... You have questions.... But you aren&apos;t them! You... You&apos;re outerminds!)</string>
  <string id="13137">(You can help me... help us! Please, you have to help!)</string>
  <string id="13139">(Please. Come back and help us!)</string>
  <string id="13140">(Bring them... Bring them back....)</string>
  <string id="13142">We&apos;re working on that.</string>
  <string id="13146">So everything is well again?</string>
  <string id="13147">Glad we could help!</string>

  <string id="13150">Don&apos;t worry. Thebes will help you.</string>
  <string id="13152">You&apos;re not alone. We&apos;re working on that.</string>
  <string id="13156">We&apos;ll see what we can do.</string>

  <string id="13159">Why would the Nocturnus want to jam the Overmind?</string>
  <string id="13160">What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="13161">Might I ask you a few questions?</string>
  <string id="13163">What can we do to help you?</string>
  <string id="13165">Sorry. We have too much to do.</string>
  <string id="13167">Me either. Moving along.</string>
  <string id="13169">They weren&apos;t so tough!</string>
  <string id="13171">I think this machine could be what was causing Croesus and his family so much trouble!</string>
  <string id="13174">That ought to take care of it. Let&apos;s go tell Croesus the news!</string>
  <string id="13175">I don&apos;t think so. It seems to have been rooted to the spot!</string>
  <string id="13176">Right!</string>
  <string id="13182">Wait, Sonic. Are those Nocturnus scouts?</string>
  <string id="13183">Maybe they&apos;re the ones Croesus saw before. I wonder if they have anything to do with his family&apos;s problem!</string>
  <string id="13185">What does it do?</string>
  <string id="13190">Could we take it with us? It could be handy.</string>
  <string id="13191">Shut it down.</string>
  <string id="13200">(I still can&apos;t hear them. Please, help me!)</string>
  <string id="13201">(Please... Won&apos;t someone help me?)</string>
  <string id="13202">How can we help you?</string>
  <string id="13205">If you don&apos;t have your Haniman charms, you&apos;re Night Stalker food!</string>
  <string id="13208">Not much other than the stories. I&apos;m glad my friend Haniman gave me a discount on a protective charm.</string>
  <string id="13209">Such a horrible mess, it is. Strange that the military isn&apos;t acting to stop the beast. General Raxos must have more important things to do.</string>
  <string id="13210">What can you tell us about the Night Stalker?</string>
  <string id="13219">Good day, friends. It&apos;s good to see friendly faces in such terrible times.</string>
  <string id="13220">Might I interest you in a protective charm?</string>
  <string id="13221">Bless you that you haven&apos;t heard! These parts are the hunting grounds of the deadly Night Stalker, my friend.</string>
  <string id="13222">Few have seen the beast, but there are tales of good Zoah citizens taken in the night.</string>
  <string id="13223">Ahh. Such horrible days that a name such as mine should be known throughout the colony.</string>
  <string id="13225">What&apos;s so terrible about these times?</string>
  <string id="13227">Why would I need a protective charm?</string>
  <string id="13228">You must be this &quot;Haniman&quot; I&apos;ve heard about.</string>
  <string id="13230">No, thanks. We&apos;ll be going now.</string>
  <string id="13231">Don&apos;t think I won&apos;t call the guards!</string>
  <string id="13232">What are you doing in my home? Go! Get out!</string>
  <string id="13233">Night Stalker! Everyone&apos;s talking about the Night Stalker. Everyone&apos;s saying, &quot;Sorry for your sons, Telra!&quot;</string>
  <string id="13234">Ha! Those kids got what they deserve!</string>
  <string id="13235">How can she say that?!</string>
  <string id="13236">Good riddance, I say!</string>
  <string id="13237">What? No! They weren&apos;t taken by some Night Stalker!</string>
  <string id="13238">They were arrested! For vandalism, no less! Stupid boys, with no respect for public property!</string>
  <string id="13239">And then this Night Stalker thing popped up, and I figured, why not let people think the boys were taken?</string>
  <string id="13240">People keep giving me things and saying they&apos;re sorry. Beats being shunned for having no-good sons!</string>
  <string id="13241">Ha! I like her!</string>
  <string id="13242">And don&apos;t you go telling anyone! I don&apos;t need this hassle!</string>
  <string id="13243">Good. Now get out of my house!</string>
  <string id="13244">For what? They&apos;re the ones committing stupid crimes. Why shouldn&apos;t they learn a lesson in the General&apos;s prison?</string>
  <string id="13245">No, they&apos;re fine where they are, thanks.</string>
  <string id="13246">Now get out! I know who you are, and don&apos;t think I won&apos;t call the guards!</string>
  <string id="13247">Finally. Someone keeps to their own business. Good. Now get out of my house!</string>
  <string id="13248">Right! And stay out!</string>
  <string id="13249">What happened to your sons?</string>
  <string id="13250">I wanted to ask you about the Night Stalker.</string>
  <string id="13254">They deserved to be taken by the Night Stalker?</string>
  <string id="13260">Fair enough. We&apos;ll be going now.</string>
  <string id="13261">Don&apos;t you want them out of jail?</string>
  <string id="13265">What happened to them?</string>
  <string id="13266">If she doesn&apos;t care, I don&apos;t care.</string>
  <string id="13268">Sorry. We&apos;ll be leaving.</string>
  <string id="13270">I heard the Night Stalker was a fake!</string>
  <string id="13272">I don&apos;t want to be like Telra! The Night Stalker took her sons!</string>
  <string id="13276">Welcome back, friends. I understand you put an end to my friend Haniman&apos;s little scam.</string>
  <string id="13277">I still can&apos;t believe he&apos;d do something like that. I hope he gets what he deserves.</string>
  <string id="13278">Is there something I can do for you?</string>
  <string id="13279">He is an old friend of mine. He was an engineer not too long ago, but he began selling protective charms when the Night Stalker first attacked.</string>
  <string id="13280">He makes a tidy profit from the charms, but rightfully so. Those charms are keeping people safe from the Night Stalker!</string>
  <string id="13281">No idea. You could ask him, but I doubt he&apos;d tell you. He has a good thing going there, and he wouldn&apos;t reveal his source!</string>
  <string id="13282">The soldiers are on the prowl today. Best to be careful!</string>
  <string id="13285">What do you know about Haniman?</string>
  <string id="13287">Where did he find the charms?</string>
  <string id="13288">My friends! You return!</string>
  <string id="13289">Has something happened? You finally see the need for one of my protective charms?</string>
  <string id="13290">You... How could you... I mean-- Oh, happy day!</string>
  <string id="13291">We know all about your holographic &quot;monster&quot;, Haniman.</string>
  <string id="13292">Oh, do you? But who will the guards believe? You, a non-citizen, or me, a well-liked merchant out to save the people from evil?</string>
  <string id="13293">Sonic, I think that machine in the corner is the holo-emitter!</string>
  <string id="13306">Perhaps you feel a need for a protective charm?</string>
  <string id="13307">A terrible beast known as the Night Stalker prowls these streets, taking families and children from their homes! </string>
  <string id="13308">Why, it took young Telra&apos;s family just the other night! A sad, sad occurrence!</string>
  <string id="13309">Terrible, terrible that I am forced to sell these trinkets of protection to stave off the hungry beast.</string>
  <string id="13313">You spoke to her, eh? I--I only know what I was told. I don&apos;t know why she would hide the truth like that.</string>
  <string id="13314">I suppose in the face of such tragedy, she must handle it the best she can.</string>
  <string id="13316">What&apos;s that? Oh no! Everyone, run! The Stalker approaches!</string>
  <string id="13318">We&apos;re doomed!</string>
  <string id="13321">What? Why would you... Oh, no one finds the Night Stalker. It finds you! Few who have seen it lived to tell the tale.</string>
  <string id="13322">Of course. Do be careful out there, my friends.</string>
  <string id="13323">Please, consider your safety. Should you feel threatened, return here for your protective charms!</string>
  <string id="13324">Yes... yes, I was. But I became a merchant when I found that I could do some good selling these charms to the people!</string>
  <string id="13328">Well... I... Of course! I have to eat, don&apos;t I? We all must make our way in these dangerous times.</string>
  <string id="13329">Oh, such a tragedy. The Night Stalker plucked away her sons in the prime of their youth!</string>
  <string id="13331">Of course. This one&apos;s on the house, my friend. One&apos;s safety is important!</string>
  <string id="13332">Of course. Be safe, my friends.</string>
  <string id="13334">We defeated your &quot;Night Stalker&quot;, Haniman.</string>
  <string id="13356">Telra says her sons were arrested for vandalism.</string>
  <string id="13361">Where could I find this Night Stalker?</string>
  <string id="13368">We&apos;d better be going.</string>
  <string id="13371">I&apos;ve been told you were once an engineer.</string>
  <string id="13372">You&apos;re making a profit from these charms, yes?</string>
  <string id="13376">Can you tell me anything about Telra&apos;s family?</string>
  <string id="13377">I&apos;ll take one of the charms.</string>
  <string id="13379">Sonic! There&apos;s something wrong! This so-called Night Stalker is a fake!</string>
  <string id="13380">Wait. There&apos;s something not right about that creature! Let me just scan it for a second....</string>
  <string id="13382">Just as I thought! This so-called Night Stalker is a fake!</string>
  <string id="13384">A hologram! </string>
  <string id="13385">I don&apos;t.... I think I can trace the signal....</string>
  <string id="13386">Yes! It seems to be coming from the merchants&apos; area... close to where we spoke to Haniman!</string>
  <string id="13387">I knew he sounded shifty when we spoke to him.</string>
  <string id="13388">And it attacked even though Sonic had one of those charms!</string>
  <string id="13389">This Haniman has a lot of explaining to do.</string>
  <string id="13390">No, apparently not. But I think I can detect the source of the signal.</string>
  <string id="13391">Wait. Something&apos;s not right here. I&apos;m detecting a weird energy flux.</string>
  <string id="13392">Could it be the Night Stalker?</string>
  <string id="13393">Be careful, team!</string>
  <string id="13402">Where&apos;s it coming from?</string>
  <string id="13408">So the Night Stalker doesn&apos;t exist?</string>
  <string id="13410">Ha. I wonder if that Haniman is involved.</string>
  <string id="13411">Hold steady, team.</string>
  <string id="13417">You&apos;ve returned! Have you found anything for ol&apos; Nestor?</string>
  <string id="13418">Oh, that&apos;s lovely. A portion of tectonic plating! Ah, just like mother used to forge!</string>
  <string id="13419">Wonderful! It just takes me back to a happier time.</string>
  <string id="13420">I think that&apos;s all I need! My home is getting filled up with knick-knacks!</string>
  <string id="13421">So. As promised, some information. I just finished decoding the Precursor script on this tablet I found.</string>
  <string id="13422">It says that Precursors studied the other races in the Twilight Cage at the time and realized that they were all powerful and dangerous.</string>
  <string id="13423">When I think about it, my clan was at the height of our power when we were brought here. And the Kron, the N&apos;rrgal, the Zoah, and the Voxai....</string>
  <string id="13424">All are dangerous in their own way. It seems odd that we&apos;d all wind up here together, doesn&apos;t it?</string>
  <string id="13427">I&apos;ll hang on to this and see what else I can learn.</string>
  <string id="13433">I thought I&apos;d never see anything like this again!</string>
  <string id="13434">Let&apos;s see... got anything else?</string>
  <string id="13435">I suppose that&apos;s it. Well, thank you, my friend. Just seeing these bits of my home raises my spirits!</string>
  <string id="13436">Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
  <string id="13437">All right. Be careful out there!</string>
  <string id="13438">I... I&apos;m sorry. I&apos;m getting emotional.</string>
  <string id="13439">Oh, oh my. I seem to have something in my eye....</string>
  <string id="13440">Here. Take this for your troubles. And thank you!</string>
  <string id="13441">Is that--? Yes! A Mark I Gizoid Body Shell!</string>
  <string id="13442">Ah, I remember. There used to be Gizoids all over the place. I even called one of them friend!</string>
  <string id="13443">Too bad, though. After we were stranded here, I couldn&apos;t find him. I guess he never made it through the wormhole.</string>
  <string id="13445">The ultimate in technological achievement! Powerful androids, essentially. For most things, they are fantastic. In battle, they are unbeatable!</string>
  <string id="13446">Emerl? You know a Gizoid named Emerl? We never named them.</string>
  <string id="13447">I suppose if he was in your world, and you met him, then it must be him! All others were accounted for!</string>
  <string id="13448">Such a sad story. He was our finest creation, but he had such a temper....</string>
  <string id="13449">Wait... I thought the Fourth Great Civilization built the Gizoids!</string>
  <string id="13451">Fourth Great Civilization? Really? Impressive. Lord Ix will be pleased to know the Nocturnus went into the history books.</string>
  <string id="13452">But didn&apos;t Emerl destroy the Fourth Great Civilization?</string>
  <string id="13453">Oh, he did destroy us, from a certain point of view.</string>
  <string id="13454">The Gizoids were the pinnacle of our technological achievement. And your &quot;Emerl&quot; was the best of them all!</string>
  <string id="13455">With the power of the Gizoids, no one could defeat Ix. Not even the mighty Pachacamac could do more than stall him.</string>
  <string id="13456">Lord Ix led us to conquest and battle, with the Gizoids at the head of the army. Such violence and death!</string>
  <string id="13457">And then, suddenly, we were gone, whisked away to this place. Coincidence? Maybe. But perhaps there&apos;s more to it.</string>
  <string id="13458">Maybe we shouldn&apos;t tell him.</string>
  <string id="13459">Why, we created them, of course! Built in the very labs that function within the Nocturne to this day!</string>
  <string id="13460">Ah! What a lovely B-level coupler! It will look great on my mantle!</string>
  <string id="13461">Hm. I haven&apos;t seen a force-spanner like this in a long while! I almost forgot what they looked like!</string>
  <string id="13462">Excellent! You know, a good Y-button conducer always brings a smile to my face.</string>
  <string id="13463">I don&apos;t see anything. Oh, well. Bring me Nocturne Relics, and I&apos;ll make it worth your while!</string>
  <string id="13464">Oh? Interesting. What is it?</string>
  <string id="13465">Wow. This is Precursor script! This is very old indeed!</string>
  <string id="13466">Well, this works with my own theory, but I can&apos;t believe it could be true!</string>
  <string id="13467">Interesting. The Precursors wrote that they spoke with the other races here in their time. They were trying to get an idea how long they&apos;d all been here.</string>
  <string id="13468">Strange. There isn&apos;t much written on this one. Or rather, what is written is just repeated over and over!</string>
  <string id="13470">Oh, hello. Sorry, ol&apos; Nestor&apos;s just feeling a little homesick. It&apos;ll pass.</string>
  <string id="13471">I heard there were outworlders here on the Kron colony, but I didn&apos;t believe it!</string>
  <string id="13473">I am Nestor, historian and scholar of the Nocturnus Clan. You have nothing to fear from me, I swear it!</string>
  <string id="13474">No.... Impossible! How could you be Nestor the Wise?</string>
  <string id="13475">Nestor the Wise? Ha! That&apos;s interesting. I&apos;ll have to write that down.</string>
  <string id="13477">Ever since the Argus Event, all Lord Ix cares about is conquest and battle. Making machines of war, conquering the Twilight Cage for his own ends.</string>
  <string id="13478">I was exiled for speaking out against this attitude. And I think I got off easy.</string>
  <string id="13479">But I heard the Kron were mounting a rebellion against Ix, so I thought this might be the safest place.</string>
  <string id="13480">Ah. A history buff, are you? What if I said I won&apos;t tell you? Or rather, I&apos;ll tell you what I do know... for a price?</string>
  <string id="13481">I--I miss the Nocturne. Time spent on this rock has made me homesick.</string>
  <string id="13482">If you could bring me objects, things that would remind me of the Nocturne, I would be glad to reward you with the finest gift of all: knowledge.</string>
  <string id="13483">Wonderful! I feel better already!</string>
  <string id="13484">Search each of the Twilight Cage colonies for cast-off remnants of the Nocturne. I&apos;ll see what I can scrape together to reward your efforts!</string>
  <string id="13485">Hope to see you again soon!</string>
  <string id="13486">That&apos;s the thing. When the Nocturne was brought into the Twilight Cage, parts of it broke off and landed on the other colonies.</string>
  <string id="13487">If you would search the other colonies for those parts and bring them to me, I could use them to decorate my house and remember my home.</string>
  <string id="13491">Interested in Ix&apos;s motivations, are you? What if I said I won&apos;t tell you? Or rather, I&apos;ll tell you what I do know... for a price?</string>
  <string id="13492">Nestor the Wise was the most famous echidna historian of all time! His chronicles of the ancient times are legendary.</string>
  <string id="13493">I suppose I should feel honored! Though I certainly don&apos;t feel like a legend! Ha!</string>
  <string id="13494">Sure, sure. But if you&apos;re ever interested in a little search for history, let me know!</string>
  <string id="13495">Of course. Stay safe!</string>
  <string id="13496">This is Nestor the Wise, Sonic. I doubt we have anything to worry about with him. His histories were often critical of the Nocturnus leaders.</string>
  <string id="13497">Ha! You have read them! </string>
  <string id="13498">No.... Impossible! How could he be Nestor the Wise?</string>
  <string id="13499">We found something for your home.</string>
  <string id="13520">Nothing for now.</string>
  <string id="13528">I&apos;m sorry to hear that. Moving on!</string>
  <string id="13529">What is a Gizoid?</string>
  <string id="13530">Let&apos;s move on.</string>
  <string id="13531">A lost Gizoid? Could that have been Emerl?</string>
  <string id="13543">Where did the Nocturnus get Gizoids?</string>
  <string id="13549">Could you take a look at this tablet we found?</string>
  <string id="13551">You mentioned an &quot;Argus Event&quot; before. What&apos;s that?</string>
  <string id="13552">Why would Ix want to conquer the Twilight Cage?</string>
  <string id="13557">What are you doing here, Nestor?</string>
  <string id="13561">Is there any way we can help you?</string>
  <string id="13562">Wait. What is &quot;the Argus Event&quot;?</string>
  <string id="13565">We&apos;ll see what we can do.</string>
  <string id="13569">What kinds of objects do you need?</string>
  <string id="13574">Why would Ix want to conquer the Twilight Cage?</string>
  <string id="13576">Do you know him, Knuckles?</string>
  <string id="13578">We should be going.</string>
  <string id="13579">A search for history?</string>
  <string id="13580">Maybe some other time.</string>
  <string id="13582">I don&apos;t trust you.</string>

A GUN agent chased the gang, but they escaped him. When Sonic and friends came along, the GUN agent asked them to capture the gangsters.&#13;

  <string id="13603">Sonic met a man who was worried about his son, Timmy. It seems Timmy fell down a well in Blue Ridge Zone and hasn&apos;t been seen since.&#13;
&#13;
The man asked Sonic and friends to save Timmy!</string>
  <string id="13604">Sonic and friends searched for Timmy, who had fallen down a well. Timmy&apos;s dad was very worried about him!&#13;
&#13;
The team found Timmy--actually Timothy, a grown man whose job is to clean and preserve the inside of the well. Since Timothy was done working for the day, he agreed to go back to his father with Sonic.</string>
  <string id="13605">Timmy fell into a well, and his worried father asked Sonic and team to rescue Timmy and bring him home. &#13;
&#13;
Timmy was actually Timothy, a grown-up who works inside the well. His father is just getting a little crazy!&#13;
&#13;
The team brought Timothy to his father, who was very happy to see him.</string>
  <string id="13606">Timmy&apos;s in Trouble!</string>
  <string id="13608">Whoa. Who are you?</string>
  <string id="13609">Rescue? I didn&apos;t ask to be rescued. Oh, no. Have you been speaking to my father?</string>
  <string id="13610">Oh, really? Cool. I&apos;ve never met a celebrity. Oh, no. Have you been speaking to my father?</string>
  <string id="13612">Timmy? No... Oh, no. Have you been speaking to my father?</string>
  <string id="13613">My name is Timothy. My father&apos;s getting on in age. He seems to think I&apos;m still ten years old. </string>
  <string id="13615">I work down here. I seal cracks and keep animals and stuff out of the well. </string>
  <string id="13616">Fine. I was more or less done here, anyway. You can help me carry my stuff.</string>
  <string id="13617">Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="13618">It means I wasn&apos;t in any danger. My father&apos;s just a kook.</string>
  <string id="13619">Anyway, I was more or less done here, so I&apos;ll just go with you. You can help me carry my stuff.</string>
  <string id="13620">I&apos;m the guy who&apos;s rescuing you. Come on!</string>
  <string id="13622">I&apos;m Sonic the Hedgehog!</string>

  <string id="13629">Well, you&apos;re coming with us, anyway.</string>
  <string id="13632">Does that mean you want to stay here?</string>
  <string id="13635">Are you all right, son?</string>
  <string id="13636">Yes, Father. I&apos;m fine. Just like I am every day when I get home from work.</string>
  <string id="13637">Thank you so much, Sonic. Please, take this. It&apos;s not much, but it may come in handy.</string>

  <string id="13642">Great! He fell into a well to the north. He must be so scared!</string>
  <string id="13644">Thank you!</string>
  <string id="13645">I don&apos;t know. I always tell him not to play out there, but the one moment I&apos;m not watching, there he goes!</string>
  <string id="13646">I was mad at first, but now I&apos;m just worried. Please help him!</string>
  <string id="13647">I understand you must be busy, but....</string>
  <string id="13648">If you change your mind, please help him. He&apos;s in a well to the north!</string>
  <string id="13652">You&apos;re welcome!</string>

  <string id="13785">The piratesss are starrrving the merchannnts....</string>
  <string id="13787">When will the military stop those pirates from raiding merchant ships?</string>
  <string id="13790">(Pirates... yes! I have heard tales of pirates in the spaces between the colonies, attacking supply ships and taking their cargo.)</string>
  <string id="13791">(I seem to remember that the Kron were the last ones hit. A shipment of ore meant for the Zoah, if I recall.)</string>
  <string id="13792">(Maybe speaking with the trader on the Kron colony will bring you more information.)</string>
  <string id="13793">Do you know anything about pirates?</string>
  <string id="13796">Ha. Of course I do. I was expecting a shipment from the Kron colony when it was attacked by these so-called &quot;pirates.&quot; </string>
  <string id="13798">Do you know anything about pirates?</string>
  <string id="13801">No one knows who they are, just that they attack cargo ships carrying certain types of cargo.</string>
  <string id="13802">No merchant vessel will fly between colonies anymore, for fear the pirates might get them. It&apos;s terrible.</string>
  <string id="13803">Oh, no. I&apos;m not sending anything out. Not with you, not with anyone!</string>
  <string id="13804">Someone has to have a shipment they need to send. I have nothing worth the risk of a pirate attack.</string>
  <string id="13807">Where could we get the right kind of cargo?</string>
  <string id="13809">Pirrrates... They attack merchannnt ships, steal valuable supplllies....</string>
  <string id="13810">We have a shipmmment of N&apos;rrgal sweat for Kronnn. We&apos;re afrrraid to sennnd it....</string>
  <string id="13811">Why would you do that?</string>
  <string id="13812">We can defeat those pirates! The shipment will get there, we promise!</string>
  <string id="13813">Mmmaybe you are the onnnly channnce. Nnno othersss have faced themmm and wonnn....</string>

  <string id="13818">We&apos;ll deliver the shipment for you!</string>
  <string id="13822">We&apos;ll take care of it.</string>
  <string id="13823">Arrr. Ye got us. Turn &apos;er &apos;round, boys.</string>
  <string id="13824">Wait. You&apos;re echidnas, from the Nocturnus Clan, right? Why were you attacking merchant ships?</string>
  <string id="13825">We don&apos;t approve of Lord Ix&apos;s methods, aye. He&apos;s tryin&apos; t&apos;unite the colonies, he is, plannin&apos; t&apos;leave the Twilight Cage and hitch ship to the old country.</string>
  <string id="13826">We rather like it here. Lots of space. So we figured we&apos;d spread a little chaos. Keep the lubbers distant, as it were. </string>
  <string id="13828">Aye. And ye&apos;ll do it better, I reckon.</string>
  <string id="13829">Arr. If ye&apos;ll let us go, we&apos;ll leave ye to it. We won&apos;t be gettin&apos; in the way no more.</string>
  <string id="13830">Promise?</string>
  <string id="13831">Aye. Me word is me bond. But here, take this as a token of me goodwill.</string>
  <string id="13832">Rally &apos;round, boys! We&apos;re settin&apos; sail!</string>
  <string id="13834">Sheesh. What a ham.</string>
  <string id="13837">Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="13838">Aye. I see that now. </string>
  <string id="13839">Why waste fuel stealing from the colonies? We could go out, explore! Arr! A great adventure t&apos;be had!</string>
  <string id="13841">What was that?</string>
  <string id="13842">Must be those pirates. Everyone, get ready!</string>
  <string id="13844">Harr! Give up yer booty, yer cargo is ours now!</string>
  <string id="13845">Why is he talking like that?</string>
  <string id="13846">Who knows? Just go with it.</string>
  <string id="13847">Hand it over, lubbers! Or ye&apos;ll be forced to walk the plank!</string>
  <string id="13848">Seriously. Why would a pirate from another dimension talk like that?</string>
  <string id="13849">Arr, this be just how I talk! Now--</string>
  <string id="13850">This is stupid.</string>
  <string id="13851">Aye. A speech impediment it be.</string>
  <string id="13853">We gonna fight, or not?</string>
  <string id="13854">Yeah. Bring it on!</string>
  <string id="13859">That&apos;s almost what we&apos;re trying to do.</string>
  <string id="13870">You&apos;re going about this the wrong way.</string>
  <string id="13872">Just hand over any other shipments you have.</string>
  <string id="13888">And we have the payment from the Kron!</string>
  <string id="13889">The pirrrates arrre nnno mmmore! We arrre... surrrprised... but pleasssed....</string>
  <string id="13890">Take thisss as paymmment for your effortsss.... For makinnng the starrrs safe againnn....</string>
  <string id="13891">You did? Wonnnderful! Annnd where is mmmy paymennnt?</string>
  <string id="13892">Take the shipmmment to the Kronnn and brinnng back mmmy paymennnt. That was the deal....</string>
  <string id="13894">We took care of the pirates.</string>
  <string id="13899">Move more smoothly do things since stopped you the pirates.</string>
  <string id="13900">Welcome I you back. Survived you the pirates, suppose I. </string>
  <string id="13901">Then defeated have you the pirates? Done you have the impossible!</string>
  <string id="13902">Give I you the payment for shipment. And... give I you discount! </string>
  <string id="13903">Tell I everyone! Defeated are the pirates!</string>
  <string id="13904">Hope you that you won&apos;t. Nasty creatures they.</string>
  <string id="13905">Know I that take advantage some people do of others.</string>
  <string id="13906">Raid they shipments through the Cage. Steal they valuable equipment.</string>
  <string id="13907">Detect they cargo somehow. Attack they only ships carrying valuable supplies. Ore, water, and the like.</string>
  <string id="13908">Expect I a shipment from a trader on N&apos;rrgal colony. Send he will a cargo of N&apos;rrgal sweat. Good fuel is that.</string>
  <string id="13909">But afraid he is to send it. Afraid he is that attack pirates will. </string>
  <string id="13910">Unsure I of your chances. But better it is than nothing.</string>
  <string id="13911">Hope I that someone stops them.</string>
  <string id="13912">Steady ground.</string>
  <string id="13913">Pirates. Hear I once more that word, and destroy I this shop.</string>
  <string id="13914">We have a shipment from the N&apos;rrgal.</string>
  <string id="13917">We haven&apos;t yet met any pirates.</string>
  <string id="13918">Do you know anything about pirates?</string>
  <string id="13921">Where can I get such supplies?</string>
  <string id="13923">We&apos;ll get the shipment and bring it here safely.</string>
  <string id="13924">That&apos;s interesting. Thanks!</string>
  <string id="13925">We&apos;ll be going now.</string>
  <string id="13926">Thanks. We&apos;ll be going now!</string>
  <string id="13928">I hear you&apos;ve had some trouble with pirates.</string>
  <string id="13931">Wait, Sonic. I think I... yes! There&apos;s a Precursor tablet down here!</string>
  <string id="13932">It must have been hidden in the spawning pools for decades! The swatbot must have disturbed it!</string>
  <string id="13933">Maybe if we go back to the Kron colony, Nestor can help us figure out what it says!</string>
  <string id="13934">I can&apos;t make out what it says. Maybe we can find someone who can!</string>
  <string id="13935">Wait, Sonic. There&apos;s some kind of strange tablet down here! </string>
  <string id="13952">(The voice, so comforting. Is that... Thebes? Did something happen to the Overmind?)</string>
  <string id="13953">(Ah, yes. I see. You defeated the Overmind! And you saved my family from the unbearable silence!)</string>
  <string id="13954">(Now that I&apos;m connected again, I know everything the Voxai know. I might have something else for you!)</string>
  <string id="13955">(Yes! The Overmind is concerned that Thebes is hiding something in his house... something you might like to have! If you want it, go look around in Thebes&apos; home!)</string>
  <string id="13957">(I cannot thank you enough for your help. Good luck against Lord Ix, and keep an eye out for bubbles!)</string>
  <string id="13963">Hm. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything....</string>
  <string id="13964">No, wait! There! Thebes has a Precursor tablet! He wanted us to have it!</string>
  <string id="13965">Maybe if we go back to the Kron colony, Nestor can help us figure out what it says!</string>
  <string id="13966">Weird writing.</string>
  <string id="13967">I can&apos;t make out what it says. Maybe we can find someone who can!</string>
  <string id="13968">No, wait. There&apos;s some kind of strange tablet here. Why would Thebes want us to have that?</string>
  <string id="13975">They left us a Precursor tablet! But why would that pirate have it?</string>
  <string id="13976">The pirates left us some kind of strange tablet! But why would that pirate have it?</string>
  <string id="13977">Must have been part of his booty.</string>
  <string id="13978">Rouge!</string>
  <string id="13979">What? It&apos;s a word.</string>
  <string id="13980">Maybe if we go back to the Kron colony, Nestor can help us figure out what it says!</string>
  <string id="13981">We have to take this shipment back to the Kron colony, anyway.</string>
  <string id="13982">I can&apos;t make out what it says. Maybe we can find someone who can!</string>
  <string id="13983">Let&apos;s get this shipment back to the Kron colony as soon as possible!</string>
  <string id="13994">And as promised, some information. I just finished decoding the script on this tablet I found.</string>
  <string id="13995">After we ended up here, I did some research and learned of a race who lived here long before the others got here.</string>
  <string id="13996">I called them the Precursors. I found a cipher for decoding their script, but I haven&apos;t learned much else about them.</string>
  <string id="13997">There are Precursor tablets in all lands of the Twilight Cage. You should consider yourself lucky to have found this one!</string>
  <string id="13998">It says, &quot;The will of Argus, must escape Argus.&quot; I wonder... hmm....</string>
  <string id="13999">Could Argus be the name of the higher being that created this place? Could this Argus be a god?</string>
  <string id="14000">Imprisoned by a god in another dimension. This is worse than I thought!</string>
  <string id="14001">Go, my friends. Find a way out, before it&apos;s too late! I--I have nothing left to learn. Nothing left but to accept my fate!</string>
  <string id="14002">There has to be a way out for you!</string>
  <string id="14003">We were put here for a reason. No, my friends, I must go and... think.</string>
  <string id="14005">I will be fine. Here in Argus&apos; Cage.</string>
  <string id="14006">It says that from what they could tell, time works differently here. A day here could be years in one world, or seconds in another!</string>
  <string id="14007">That explains a lot, including why I&apos;m a legend in your world when, as far as I can tell, we&apos;ve only been here a few years!</string>
  <string id="14008">Can I keep this? It could have a serious effect on my scientific studies!</string>
  <string id="14009">It says here that the Precursors believed there is a higher being that created the Twilight Cage!</string>
  <string id="14010">Perhaps that being is the one that brought everyone here. Perhaps that being is behind the so-called Argus Event!</string>
  <string id="14011">When we were brought here, no one knew what had happened. One moment we&apos;re all living in our world, and suddenly we&apos;re all here. </string>
  <string id="14012">The weird thing was that we all remembered hearing a strange word in our minds. The word sounded like &quot;Argus.&quot;</string>
  <string id="14013">Lord Ix took to calling it the Argus Event.</string>
  <string id="14014">I&apos;d like to keep this. I&apos;ll see if there&apos;s anything else I can learn.</string>
  <string id="14015">This seems to say that the Precursors thought the Twilight Cage was a kind of prison, and that they were brought here to suffer.</string>
  <string id="14016">I suppose that makes sense. This certainly isn&apos;t a paradise, by any means.</string>
  <string id="14017">Interesting. I&apos;d like to hold on to this, see if I can get anything else out of it.</string>
  <string id="14018">Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
  <string id="14019">If you find any more of these tablets, please bring them to me. There&apos;s much we can learn from the Precursors!</string>
  <string id="14020">Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
  <string id="14021">Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
  <string id="14022">Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
  <string id="14023">Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
  <string id="14024">Oh? Interesting. What is it?</string>
  <string id="14025">Oh? Interesting. What is it?</string>
  <string id="14026">Oh? Interesting. What is it?</string>
  <string id="14027">Oh? Interesting. What is it?</string>
  <string id="14029">What does it say?</string>
  <string id="14030">What is Precursor script?</string>
  <string id="14048">Interesting.</string>
  <string id="14049">What is the Argus Event?</string>
  <string id="14053">So, tell me: What was the Argus Event you mentioned?</string>
  <string id="14057">I have another tablet for you.</string>
  <string id="14058">Nothing at the moment.</string>

  <string id="14068">Sonic and friends investigated the contamination in the N&apos;rrgal spawning pools. They discovered that it wasn&apos;t the Zoah who poisoned the pools, but rather a Swatbot pulled into the Twilight Cage when the wormhole opened over Metropolis.&#13;

The team spoke to Haniman about the Night Stalker, but he wasn&apos;t of much help. The Night Stalker has to be around somewhere, though. Maybe the team could search the Zoah Colony for signs of the Night Stalker!</string>
  <string id="14170">Find Telra and see if she knows more about the Night Stalker.&#13;
&#13;
Tragedy has befallen a woman named Telra. Rumor has it her son was taken by the Night Stalker! Maybe speaking with her will shed some light on this terrible beast.</string>
  <string id="14171">Well, that was an interesting visit with Telra.&#13;
&#13;
Telra&apos;s son did vanish, but he wasn&apos;t taken by a hideous monster. Instead, he was arrested for vandalism, and his mother isn&apos;t the least bit sorry about his fate. &#13;
&#13;
Strange, though. Why would there be rumors that the Night Stalker took her boy?</string>
  <string id="14174">Well, that was an interesting visit with Telra.&#13;
&#13;
Telra&apos;s son did vanish, but he wasn&apos;t taken by a hideous monster. Instead, he was arrested for vandalism, and his mother isn&apos;t the least bit sorry about his fate. At least someone gained something from the boy&apos;s disappearance, though. Haniman must have used the disappearance to create paranoia and drive sales of his anti-Night-Stalker charms.</string>
  <string id="14175">The Night Stalker: Telra</string>
  <string id="14176">Find someone who has more information about the Night Stalker.&#13;
&#13;
Rumor has it that a man named Haniman is selling charms to ward away the Night Stalker. Maybe this Haniman knows something about the terrible beast!</string>
  <string id="14177">Find someone who has more information about the Night Stalker.&#13;
&#13;
In the Zoah Colony, Sonic spoke with a merchant who knows Haniman, the one selling charms that ward away the Night Stalker. The merchant was friends with Haniman back when Haniman was an engineer, and he says that Haniman is making a tidy profit from the charms.</string>
  <string id="14179">It turns out that Haniman was behind the appearance of the Night Stalker all along. &#13;
&#13;
Thanks to Sonic and his friends, Haniman won&apos;t cheat anyone else ever again.</string>
  <string id="14180">The Night Stalker: Haniman</string>
  <string id="14182">Confront Haniman about the &quot;Night Stalker.&quot;&#13;
&#13;
When the team met up with the Night Stalker, it turned out to be a hologram! Tails traced the signal back to a location in the merchants&apos; area of the Zoah Colony, near where the team spoke to Haniman originally. </string>
  <string id="14183">Of course! It&apos;s a hologram!</string>
  <string id="14185">Why, you&apos;ve defeated the mighty Night Stalker! But I fear it may return....</string>
  <string id="14186">We know all about your holographic &quot;monster&quot;, Haniman.</string>
  <string id="14187">Oh, do you? But who will the guards believe? You, a non-citizen, or me, a well-liked merchant out to save the people from evil?</string>
  <string id="14188">Sonic, I think that machine in the corner is the holo-emitter!</string>
  <string id="14189">You have no chance, offworlder. You have no evidence!</string>
  <string id="14191">This is definitely the machine, Sonic. I&apos;ve pulled out its visual relay circuits.</string>
  <string id="14192">My machine!</string>
  <string id="14195">No! How could you...</string>
  <string id="14196">Now they&apos;ll all hate me! You&apos;ve ruined me!</string>
  <string id="14197">Curse you!</string>
  <string id="14198">Sonic! It looks like Haniman had a Precursor tablet in his shop!</string>
  <string id="14199">Sonic! It looks like there&apos;s some kind of strange tablet here in Haniman&apos;s store!</string>
  <string id="14200">Weird writing. I wonder where it came from?</string>
  <string id="14201">Maybe someone used it as payment for a Night Stalker charm.</string>
  <string id="14202">Maybe if we go back to the Kron colony, Nestor can help us figure out what it says!</string>
  <string id="14203">I can&apos;t make out what it says. Maybe we can find someone who can!</string>
  <string id="14204">I was out of a job! The military said they had no use for a &quot;simple&quot; holo-emitter, so I decided to show them!</string>
  <string id="14205">And I figured I could make some money on the side selling these trinkets to gullible citizens. It was a perfect plan!</string>
  <string id="14206">I would have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn&apos;t for you meddling heroes!</string>
  <string id="14207">What&apos;s going on here, Haniman?</string>
  <string id="14213">Heh. Don&apos;t we?</string>
  <string id="14218">I guess your Night Stalker is shut down for good.</string>
  <string id="14228">Why did you do it, Haniman?</string>
  <string id="14232">I think now YOU will need the protective charms!</string>

Sonic and friends have met an echidna named Nestor (or, as Knuckles calls him, &quot;Nestor the Wise&quot;) on the Kron Colony.

  <string id="14251">Keep an eye out for more of these strange tablets and bring them to Nestor the Historian on the Kron Colony.&#13;
&#13;
A race known as the Precursors lived in the Twilight Cage long before the Nocturnus Clan arrived, and the Precursors left behind tablets that contain notes about their studies of the Twilight Cage. Nestor deciphered the first Precursor tablet and discovered that the Precursors realized that all the races in the Twilight Cage were powerful and dangerous. Not much has changed since then...&#13;
&#13;
Then, from another tablet, Nestor learned that the Precursors thought the Twilight Cage was a prison of sorts, and that the races were brought there to suffer. </string>

&#13;
Nestor learned from another tablet that time works differently in the Twilight Cage. A day in the Twilight Cage could be a year in one world, or a second in another. That explains how the Nocturnus Clan can exist in the Twilight Cage, even though they vanished millennia ago from Sonic&apos;s world!</string>

&#13;
The fifth tablet was the most disturbing. Nestor says that this tablet just contained the words &quot;The Will of Argus, must escape Argus&quot; over and over. Could this Argus be a god, the being that created the Twilight Cage?&#13;
&#13;
It seems this information was too much for Nestor, who retreated into seclusion. It&apos;s likely that even if you found more tablets, Nestor won&apos;t be available to translate them.</string>
  <string id="14255">Take the strange tablet to Nestor the Historian on the Kron Colony.&#13;

  <string id="14302">Knuckles the Echidna is the last living member of his kind (on Sonic&apos;s world, at least), tasked with guarding the Master Emerald on Angel Island. After his initial teamup with Dr. Eggman (due to manipulation), he joined Sonic and Tails to form Team Sonic, the trio that ultimately took down Metal Overlord. &#13;
&#13;
Knuckles is very strong and powerful, and he will do anything to defend the Master Emerald and protect his friends. While most think Knuckles is a quiet loner, he enjoys helping Sonic, especially when the Master Emerald is threatened. He and Sonic don&apos;t always see eye to eye, but Sonic knows he can count on Knuckles to do what is needed to succeed.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to his incredible strength, Knuckles has the ability to climb using the claws on his knuckles, and he can glide for short distances. &#13;
&#13;
In combat, Knuckles has the second-highest damage power and armor in the game, and he is fast enough to attack twice per round. He is a bruiser with many ways to weaken and defeat an opponent.</string>
  <string id="14309">Shadow was created more than 50 years ago by Prof. Gerald Robotnik to be the ultimate life form. When Eggman freed him from stasis in a GUN base on Prison Island, Shadow agreed to help him take over the world. Shadow once sought revenge for the death of his friend, Maria Robotnik, but Amy Rose helped him realize that Maria&apos;s true wish was to save humanity. Soon after Shadow teamed up with Sonic to defeat Eggman, he disappeared and was presumed dead. Rouge the Bat discovered him and he joined her and E-123 Omega to form Team Dark. &#13;
&#13;
Whereas Sonic is free-spirited and independent, Shadow is a brooding loner, always serious and a little difficult to get to know. Whereas Sonic will do anything to help save the world, Shadow will stop at nothing to get what he wants or to do what he thinks is best. He tends to see enemies as obstacles rather than actual threats, and anyone who gets in his way becomes his enemy. &#13;
&#13;
Still, his friendship with Maria Robotnik showed that Shadow has compassion, and he has formed a close friendship with Rouge and Omega, his Team Dark teammates. Outside of Team Dark, however, he is rarely willing to get close to anyone. &#13;
&#13;
In combat, Shadow has medium damage power and medium armor, and he is just as quick as Sonic, giving him three attacks per round!</string>
  <string id="14310">Rouge the Bat is an enigma. As a a spy, a freelance treasure hunter, and a member of Shadow the Hedgehog&apos;s Team Dark, Rouge&apos;s motivations are always in question. In truth, she&apos;s usually just out for herself.&#13;
&#13;
Rouge is a confident, fearless, and flirty young woman, the only member of the team who uses her looks to get what she wants. Her carefree and playful attitude is fun for some and annoying to others, but she has been known to set it aside to help Shadow and Team Dark achieve their objectives. She gets along with Sonic well enough, but she always had a sort of rivalry with Amy Rose. There&apos;s a sort of unstated connection between Rouge and Knuckles that neither is overly willing to explore.&#13;
&#13;
Rouge can fly as quickly as Tails or Knuckles, but not as quickly as Shadow or Sonic can run. She is also skilled at the art of stealth, always on the lookout for gems and other valuable things to make her own. As a spy, Rouge is trained in combat and infiltration, which she uses to help her less stealthy friends.&#13;
&#13;
In combat, Rouge has low damage power and low armor, but she gets to attack twice per round, thanks to her innate quickness. Rouge&apos;s abilities to weaken and distract foes, along with her skills at stealing items from enemies, make her an asset in combat.</string>
  <string id="14311">Sonic the Hedgehog is the world&apos;s fastest supersonic hedgehog! Sonic can race faster than the wind and use his fantastic speed to overcome his enemies. Independent and carefree, Sonic never hesitates to charge into danger when the fate of the world is at stake!&#13;
&#13;
Sonic enjoys being free and unfettered, and he often travels off to adventure whenever he can. Still, he is always available when trouble rears its ugly head, and his friends always know they can count on him to do what&apos;s right. Sonic can be a little impatient and impulsive, but his confidence is unbreakable, even in the most dire circumstances. &#13;
&#13;
After the last battle against Eggman, Sonic decided to search the world for adventure. He has been gone for quite a while by the time Tails contacts him to help rescue Knuckles.&#13;
&#13;
In combat, Sonic has low damage power and low armor, but he gets three attacks per round thanks to his amazing quickness. With his speed, Sonic almost always goes first and can damage enemies before they get a chance to react!</string>
  <string id="14312">Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower is Sonic&apos;s most faithful and loyal friend. Whenever Sonic is on an adventure, Tails isn&apos;t far behind. &#13;
&#13;
As smart as Sonic is fast, Tails is an engineering genius, able to invent fantastic machines and outsmart even Eggman. His inventions, including the flying Tornado, have helped Sonic on multiple occasions. Tails can also fly by twirling his two tails like the blades of a helicopter, allowing him to go where Sonic and the team couldn&apos;t reach otherwise. &#13;
&#13;
Since Sonic left to seek adventure elsewhere, Tails has spent time alone, building new machines and helping Knuckles protect the Chaos Emeralds. As a result, he has become much more independent and confident in his abilities than he was the last time he saw Sonic. Now Tails is almost the field commander of the team, keeping track of their objectives and proposing clever plans that help the team get through difficult situations.&#13;
&#13;
In combat, Tails has low damage power and low armor, but he is quick enough to attack twice in each round. Tails relies on his team to protect him while he supports them with his special abilities.</string>
  <string id="14319">Amy Rose the Hedgehog is one of Sonic&apos;s most loyal friends. She considers herself Sonic&apos;s girlfriend, much to Sonic&apos;s dismay. But even if Sonic doesn&apos;t like her &quot;like that,&quot; she&apos;s still a valuable addition to Sonic&apos;s team.&#13;
&#13;
Amy is generally a very sweet and caring girl, and she is usually optimistic, even when she&apos;s not particularly confident. On the other hand, she can be quite aggressive if provoked, and it&apos;s sometimes not all that hard to provoke her. All you have to do is threaten or flirt with Sonic, and you can count on getting a giant Piko-Piko Hammer to the head!&#13;
&#13;
As a member of Sonic&apos;s team, Amy lends both speed and strength to the group, using her innate hedgehog speed and her immensely powerful Piko-Piko Hammer to good effect. She teams up with her friend Big the Cat and her best friend, Cream the Rabbit, to form Team Rose. Since the last time they defeated Eggman, Amy has started a club where she teaches young girls how to protect themselves from bullies.&#13;
&#13;
In combat, Amy Rose has the second highest damage power in the game, and medium armor. She is quick enough to attack twice per round, and her special abilities are valuable for weakening enemies and strengthening her teammates.</string>
  <string id="14320">One of the strongest and toughest friends Sonic has, Big the Cat definitely lives up to his name!&#13;
&#13;
Big the Cat lives in a hut in Mystic Ruins with his best friend, a pet frog named Froggy. He is a fisherman by trade, and he carries his fishing rod wherever he goes. Despite his immense size and powerful strength, Big is humble, gentle, and kind. Some would call him slow or dim-witted, but... well, those people would be right, but behind his slow wit is a heart as big as he is.&#13;
&#13;
As a member of Sonic&apos;s team, Big is most useful for his toughness, which allows him to withstand dangerous conditions that might be very dangerous for other people. He teams up with his friends Amy Rose and Cream the Rabbit to form Team Rose, and he would do anything to please and protect his friends.&#13;
&#13;
In combat, Big has medium damage power, but he has the second highest armor in the game. He&apos;s too slow to attack more than once per round, but his powerful abilities make him difficult to damage and even harder to defeat!</string>
  <string id="14321">Cream the Rabbit is a sweet young girl who loves adventure. She can fly by flapping her large ears to lift herself off the ground. With her best friend, a bow-tie-wearing Chao named Cheese, she is always willing to join Sonic on his quests to save the world from Eggman. &#13;
&#13;
Cream is polite and generally happy, but as the youngest member of Sonic&apos;s team, she is also a little naive. While she is always eager to charge off into adventure, she sometimes gets in over her head, and she must rely on Cheese or Sonic and his friends to rescue her. Over the years, she has built a sister-like friendship with Amy Rose, much as Sonic and Tails have become almost like brothers. In fact, she joins Amy and Big the Cat to form Team Rose. She is very caring and innocent, and she even helped Emerl learn about sadness and emotions after his violence made her cry.&#13;
&#13;
Cream hates violence, but she has learned to fight so she can help out Sonic and his friends. With Cheese&apos;s help, she can stand in battle next to the other characters and cheer them on to fight even harder. Even though she&apos;s young, she can still help Sonic save the world!&#13;
&#13;
In combat, Cream has low damage power and low armor, and her inexperience means she can only attack once per round. Her cheers are powerful, however, and help her teammates become stronger in battle!</string>
  <string id="14322">E-123 Omega is the last of Eggman&apos;s E-series robots. Rouge released him when she released Shadow from his stasis pod, at which point Omega, believing the hedgehog to be another one of Eggman&apos;s creations, attacked Shadow. Rouge managed to end the fight long enough to find out that Omega was angry at Eggman for imprisoning him in the abandoned base with Shadow. At that moment, Omega joined up with Rouge and Shadow to form Team Dark. Since then, he has longed for a chance to take vengeance on Eggman and prove that he is the strongest of Eggman&apos;s machines.&#13;
&#13;
Omega can be harsh and ruthless, but he does have free will, something that Eggman&apos;s robots tend to lack. While he rarely shows emotion beyond hatred and desire for revenge, Omega is capable of feeling loyalty and friendship, as he considered his Team Dark teammates to be friends. Whenever he teams up with Sonic, it&apos;s not because he likes Sonic, but because Shadow is part of the team.&#13;
&#13;
In combat, Omega has the highest damage power and armor of all characters in the game. He is so slow, however, that he only gets one attack per round.</string>
  <string id="14323">Shade the Echidna is the mysterious leader of the Marauders on Sonic&apos;s world. She is a skilled and deadly member of the Nocturnus Clan, charged with stealing the Chaos Emeralds and the Master Emerald and using them to return the Nocturnus Clan to Sonic&apos;s World!</string>
  <string id="14324">Shade the Echidna was once the leader of the Nocturnus Clan forces sent to collect the Master Emerald for the evil Ix. Now, disgraced and forsaken by her old master, she has pledged to help Sonic and his friends return the Emeralds to their rightful place. &#13;
&#13;
Shade is a tough and businesslike woman, the polar opposite of Rouge the Bat. Trained in the arts of stealth and the use of powerful, high-tech weaponry, Shade is a deadly force in combat. As a former denizen of the Twilight Cage, she is very knowledgeable about the races and places in that alternate dimension, and she is willing to help the team by telling them what she knows of Ix&apos;s secrets. She is quite impressed with both Sonic and Knuckles, and she fights alongside them to redeem herself for unknowingly contributing to Ix&apos;s plans for world domination.&#13;
&#13;
In combat, Shade has medium damage power and low armor, and she gets two attacks per round. Shade relies on trickery and technology to win in combat, with her deadly Leech Blade and her powerful Cloaking Device.</string>
  <string id="14327">Cave_Chapter3</string>
  <string id="14332">Little is known about the mysterious being known as Argus. The Nocturnus Clan historian Nestor the Wise theorizes that Argus is the super-powerful being that created the Twilight Cage and imprisoned the races within. The only source of information about Argus are tablets left behind by the Precursors, thought to be one of the first races imprisoned in the Twilight Cage. </string>
  <string id="14333">The &quot;Argus Event&quot; is the name given to the mysterious disappearance of the Nocturnus Clan and their appearance in the Twilight Cage. It was coined by a Nocturnus historian named Nestor the Wise soon after the Nocturnus arrived in the Twilight Cage.&#13;
&#13;
The term refers to a strange phenomenon that all Nocturnus echidnas experienced when they first arrived. At the moment the Nocturnus disappeared, all members of the Nocturnus Clan heard a voice in their minds say something that sounded like &quot;Argus.&quot; No one has yet been able to explain what this meant.</string>

&#13;
Around four thousand years ago, Angel Island was part of the city now known as Mystic Ruins. On Angel Island stood a shrine to the Master Emerald and the Chaos Emeralds. Pachacamac, the chief of Knuckles&apos; clan, tried to steal the Chaos Emeralds and angered its guardian spirit, who became Perfect Chaos. This god-like being virtually destroyed Knuckles&apos; clan in revenge. &#13;
&#13;
The actions of Perfect Chaos resulted in an energy backlash that ripped Angel Island from the ground, causing it to float above what is now Mystic Ruins. Before Perfect Chaos could do any more damage, Pachacamac&apos;s daughter, Tikal, managed to seal it and herself inside the Master Emerald. Over the centuries, the few surviving members of Knuckles&apos; clan became even fewer. Knuckles is, at present, the last of his kind.&#13;

Unfortunately, the Marauders recently captured Knuckles, and when Sonic and friends freed him, they all noticed that Angel Island was missing! Eggman told the team that the Marauders had somehow pulled Angel Island away from Mystic Ruins and put it on a course to the skies over Metropolis. When the Marauders&apos; leader, Ix, stole the Master Emerald, Angel Island quickly fell into the ruins of Metropolis, where it now lies, drained of all its magic.</string>

  <string id="14360">The Knuckles Clan was a race of echidnas that lived in Sonic&apos;s world thousands of years ago. They were in constant bloody conflict with the Nocturnus Clan, another clan of echidnas that lived at that time. &#13;
&#13;
The mystic Knuckles Clan lived in what is now known as Mystic Ruins. Their chief, Pachacamac, tried to steal the Chaos Emeralds, which unexpectedly unleashed Perfect Chaos and virtually wiped out the entire clan. His motives for stealing the Master Emerald are unknown, though many believe he was simply on a quest for power. &#13;

&#13;
Recently, the Nocturnus Clan and their chief, Ix, stole the Master Emerald and the seven Chaos Emeralds and took them back to their home in the Twilight Cage. When the Master Emerald was removed from its shrine on Angel Island, the floating mass plummeted to the ground, crash-landing in the middle of the ruins of Eggman&apos;s city, Metropolis.</string>
  <string id="14363">Perfect Chaos is a powerful and mysterious higher being, which Eggman refers to as the &quot;god of destruction&quot;. Perfect Chaos is actually only the most recent form of the being, taken by Chaos after it absorbed the negative energies of all seven Chaos Emeralds.&#13;
&#13;
Summoned by Pachacamac&apos;s attempt to steal the Master Emerald, Chaos attacked the echidnas and nearly wiped them all out. A peaceful echidna named Tikal, Pachacamac&apos;s daughter, soothed Chaos and managed to seal it, along with herself, inside the Master Emerald. The energy surge threw Angel Island into the air, causing it to hover over the land now known as Mystic Ruins. &#13;
&#13;
Later, Eggman released Chaos from the Master Emerald to help him in his plans for world domination. When Eggman&apos;s plans fell through thanks to Sonic and his friends, Chaos decided to take the Chaos Emeralds for himself. Chaos absorbed the negative energies from the Chaos Emeralds, becoming Perfect Chaos once more. To fight Perfect Chaos, Sonic absorbed the positive energies of the Chaos Emeralds and transformed into Super Sonic to defeat the powerful god. Defeated, Perfect Chaos transformed back into Chaos once more, and Tikal appeared to take Chaos away in a blinding flash of light. &#13;
&#13;
Neither Perfect Chaos nor Tikal have been seen since. </string>

There are a lot of different kinds of Chao in the world, each giving different powers when bonded. All Chao, however, begin as eggs and must be hatched in a Chao Garden. Chao love to meet other Chao, and interaction with others tends to make them more powerful and even cause them to mate, creating new Chao eggs.</string>

If so, it might be possible that the Nocturnus Clan echidnas were the Fourth Great Civilization. The Nocturnus historian Nestor the Wise claims that Emerl was &quot;our finest creation&quot;. According to Nestor, Emerl didn&apos;t destroy the Nocturnus Clan directly, but his creation led to the Clan&apos;s disappearance. Emerl and the Gizoids made the Nocturnus Clan unstoppable, and at the peak of their power, they were whisked away to the Twilight Cage. &#13;

If all this is true, then the Fourth Great Civilization still exists, imprisoned in the Twilight Cage. Its leader is the sinister Ix, who is obsessed with conquering the world from which he was taken.</string>

  <string id="14372">Prof. Gerald Robotnik was the grandfather of Maria Robotnik and Dr. &quot;Eggman&quot; Robotnik, and the creator of Shadow the Hedgehog. A scientific genius only matched by his psychotic grandson Eggman, Prof. Robotnik originally set out to help the world, not to destroy it. His most remarkable creation was the Space Colony ARK, where he lived and worked with his granddaughter.&#13;
&#13;
When the President of the United Federation requested his assistance on a project to discover an &quot;immortality formula,&quot; Prof. Robotnik thought of his granddaughter Maria, who was suffering from an incurable disease known as Neuro-Immune Deficiency Syndrome. He hoped the research could lead to a cure. Project Shadow used DNA from an alien known as Black Doom to create the Ultimate Life Form: Shadow the Hedgehog. Over time, the nature of the project made the government uneasy, and they considered cutting funding.&#13;
&#13;
During this time, the professor also discovered an ancient robot called a Gizoid, which could mimic combat abilities. Robotnik offered the Gizoid to the government as a bribe so he could keep Project Shadow going. Unfortunately, the bribe did not work. Sometime after the completion of Project Shadow, GUN attacked Space Colony ARK and killed Maria, sending Shadow the Hedgehog careening to the earth, presumed dead. &#13;
&#13;
When he found out about this, Robotnik went mad. He created a program that would cause the ARK to fall to earth and brainwashed Shadow to carry out the plan, which would require the power of all seven Chaos Emeralds. The plan was foiled, but in his last act before his televised execution, Dr. Robotnik condemned the world to destruction for the fate of Maria Robotnik. </string>
  <string id="14373">Gizoids are ancient robots created four thousand years ago near the end of the Fourth Great Civilization. They were created to be the ultimate military robots, capable of destroying entire armies. It is believed that they were destroyed in the fall of the Fourth Great Civilization. &#13;
&#13;
The most famous Gizoid is Emerl, the only Gizoid to survive the Fourth Great Civilization&apos;s destruction. Discovered just over fifty years ago by Prof. Gerald Robotnik, Emerl was an ancient weapon that could mimic the powers and abilities of things around him. According to Prof. Robotnik&apos;s notes, Emerl was responsible for the destruction of the Fourth Great Civilization. &#13;
&#13;
Prof. Robotnik programmed Emerl with a &quot;Soul&quot; based on the personality of his granddaughter Maria Robotnik. Unfortunately, Emerl was prone to overload when he absorbed too many abilities, and when he absorbed too many of Robotnik&apos;s weapons and machines, he destroyed a large section of the Space Colony ARK, Robotnik&apos;s orbital space station. &#13;
&#13;
Years later, Eggman found Emerl the Gizoid and gave him a Chaos Emerald as an experiment. Emerl absorbed the Emerald, and Eggman threw him away, angered that he couldn&apos;t recover the Emerald.&#13;
&#13;
Sonic later found Emerl, and Emerl bonded with him right away. Emerl slowly began to develop a personality and became a friend to Sonic and the rest of the team, but Eggman worked hard to capture the Gizoid. When Eggman finally came after him, Emerl went on a rampage, forcing Sonic to destroy him. Defeated, Emerl disappeared in a flash of light, leaving only shards of the Chaos Emeralds behind. Some believe that Emerl is still alive inside the Chaos Emeralds.</string>

According to Prof. Robotnik&apos;s notes, Emerl was responsible for the destruction of the Fourth Great Civilization. &#13;
&#13;
Prof. Robotnik programmed Emerl with a &quot;Soul&quot; based on the personality of his granddaughter Maria Robotnik. Unfortunately, Emerl was prone to overload when he absorbed too many abilities, and when he absorbed too many of Robotnik&apos;s weapons and machines, he destroyed a large section of the Space Colony ARK, Robotnik&apos;s orbital space station. &#13;
&#13;
Years later, Eggman found Emerl the Gizoid and gave him a Chaos Emerald as an experiment. Emerl absorbed the Emerald, and Eggman threw him away, angered that he couldn&apos;t recover the Emerald.&#13;
&#13;
Sonic later found Emerl, and bonded with him right away. Emerl slowly began to develop a personality and became a friend to Sonic and the rest of the team, but Eggman worked hard to capture the Gizoid. When Eggman finally came after him, Emerl went on a rampage, forcing Sonic to destroy him. Defeated, Emerl disappeared in a flash of light, leaving only shards of the Chaos Emeralds behind. Some believe that Emerl is still alive inside the Chaos Emeralds.</string>
  <string id="14375">Gizoids are ancient robots created four thousand years ago near the end of the Fourth Great Civilization. They were created to be the ultimate military robots, capable of destroying entire armies. Gizoids are powerful, and it appears that Ix and the Nocturnus Clan have created Gizoid Centurions, which are even more powerful versions of the original Gizoid design.&#13;

  <string id="14376">The Kron are a race of stone-like beings native to the Kron Colony. They are a powerful and stubborn people, known for their ability to mine precious and rare ore and build sturdy stone and metal structures.&#13;
&#13;
The Kron are believed to be the oldest race still living in the Twilight Cage, which gains them no respect from Ix or the Nocturnus. Of all the races in the Twilight Cage, the Kron are the most easy-going and &quot;simple,&quot; needing little in the way of sustenance or luxury to survive. As a result, the Nocturnus seem to view them as servants rather than allies as they employ the Kron for their mining resources and crafting abilities.&#13;
&#13;
The Kron are governed by Foreman Krag, who is mostly tasked with keeping the miners and factory workers happy. The Kron&apos;s soldiers are taken from the ranks of the laborers. They rely on their brute strength more than tactics and training to defend the colony. </string>

  <string id="14381">The Zoah are a race of warlike energy giants who live on the Zoah Colony in the Twilight Cage. Bent on conquest and domination, the Zoah seek endlessly to destroy their hated neighbors, the N&apos;rrgal. &#13;
&#13;
Zoah society is highly stratified, with a clear division between citizens and non-citizens. While citizens enjoy many rights that non-citizens don&apos;t, it seems that anyone can become a Zoah citizen if they can pass the rigorous citizenship test. There&apos;s a further division in quality of life between citizens and members of the Zoah Military. The Military are almost the Zoah noble caste and enjoy respect and luxury well beyond anything available to basic citizens. This emphasis on military might and conquest is precisely what made the Zoah attractive to Ix and the Nocturne; the stalemate between the Zoah and the N&apos;rrgal only serves to keep the Zoah&apos;s fighting skills sharp for the battle to come. &#13;
&#13;
The Zoah are ruled by General Raxos and his elite soldiers, but the non-military folks in the colony hardly consider Raxos&apos; rule to be leadership. Unfortunately, there&apos;s nothing they can really do about it.</string>

  <string id="14385">The Voxai are a race of strange, psychic beings native to the Kron Colony. As a race, they are quiet and hardworking, but their psychic powers make even the Nocturnus Clan fear to tread on their land.&#13;
&#13;
The Voxai are all connected, in a way, by a psychic signal that originates from the Voxai Overmind, three very powerful Voxai who act as one in directing the daily operations of the individual Voxai. Most of the time, the Overmind simply suggests to the citizens what they should be doing, offering gentle encouragement to the individual. Should the Overmind flex their power, though, not even the Nocturnus are immune to their mind-controlling abilities. Because of this, crime on the Voxai Colony is nonexistent, and will be as long as the Overmind maintains control. &#13;

It seems that some Voxai, including one individual named Thebes, have broken away from the Overmind. They are becoming an &quot;outermind&quot;, forming a resistance against a Voxai Overmind that is using its increasing power to dominate the entire Voxai race. &#13;

  <string id="14400">The leader of the Nocturnus Clan, the one called &quot;Lord Ix&quot;, is a mystery. Arrogant and powerful on a possibly cosmic scale, Ix and his Nocturnus Clan are some of the most dangerous enemies Sonic has ever faced!&#13;
&#13;
According to Knuckles, Ix may be an ancient echidna chief who rivaled Pachacamac thousands of years ago, and who disappeared with his people soon thereafter. Ix claims that his people have been imprisoned in the Twilight Cage, an alternate dimension where time does not pass. &#13;
&#13;
Little is known about Ix&apos;s plans, save that he intends to use the Chaos Emeralds to help bring the Nocturnus Clan back and conquer Sonic&apos;s world. He has already stolen the seven Chaos Emeralds and taken the Master Emerald back to his fortress in the Twilight Cage. </string>

  <string id="14425">Let&apos;s get going. We have a lot of work to do!</string>
  <string id="14426">Thank you so much! That stapler looks just perfect on my table!</string>
  <string id="14427">I mean, yeah, there&apos;s a certain rugged look there, but he&apos;s not my type. Too buttoned up for me.</string>
  <string id="14428">Not nearly cute enough for me to risk my neck to save him. So there better be something in this for me!</string>
  <string id="14433">The Knuckles Clan was a race of echidnas that lived in Sonic&apos;s world thousands of years ago. They were in constant bloody conflict with the Nocturnus Clan, another clan of echidnas that lived at that time. &#13;
&#13;
The mystic Knuckles Clan lived in what is now known as Mystic Ruins. Their chief, Pachacamac, tried to steal the Chaos Emeralds, which unexpectedly unleashed Perfect Chaos and virtually wiped out the entire clan. It is believed that this move was born out of desperation in the face of his clan&apos;s destruction at the hands of a rival clan. Almost immediately after Perfect Chaos nearly wiped out the Knuckles Clan, the Nocturnus Clan mysteriously disappeared, leaving the remnants of the Knuckles Clan to revive echidna society. &#13;
&#13;
Knuckles the Echidna is the only surviving member of the Knuckles Clan. The rest of his people died out in the centuries since Pachacamac&apos;s disaster. </string>

  <string id="15300">Still, thanks. I... I should go find something to do.</string>
  <string id="15301">If it is him, we&apos;ll stop him as many times as it takes.</string>
  <string id="15304">Don&apos;t worry, Amy. We&apos;ll be just fine.</string>
  <string id="15305">We&apos;ll be fine, Amy. I promise.</string>
  <string id="15307">What is it?</string>
  <string id="15310">We save the world. That&apos;s what we do!</string>
  <string id="15312">Boyfriends?</string>
  <string id="15314">We have things to do.</string>
  <string id="15316">You&apos;ll have that again. I promise.</string>
  <string id="15319">I&apos;d miss the action, honestly.</string>
  <string id="15321">Oh, sniff-sniff. Get over it.</string>
  <string id="15324">Don&apos;t be such a baby. We&apos;ll beat him like we always do!</string>
  <string id="15325">Leave Amy alone, Rouge.</string>
  <string id="15332">Good one, Rouge.</string>
  <string id="15343">We&apos;ll take care of them. I promise.</string>
  <string id="15350">It&apos;s no problem.</string>
  <string id="15355">Angel Island</string>
  <string id="15357">I--Er, right. Boyfriends.</string>
  <string id="15358">I--Er, right. Boyfriends.</string>
  <string id="15359">I--Er, right. Boyfriends.</string>
  <string id="15360">I--Er, right. Boyfriends.</string>
  <string id="15361">But I... Fine! I&apos;ll take my feelings elsewhere!</string>
  <string id="15362">But I... Fine! I&apos;ll take my feelings elsewhere!</string>
  <string id="15363">But I... Fine! I&apos;ll take my feelings elsewhere!</string>
  <string id="15364">But I... Fine! I&apos;ll take my feelings elsewhere!</string>
  <string id="15374">But I don&apos;t want you--er, anyone--to get hurt!</string>
  <string id="15375">Okay. I believe you. Thanks.</string>
  <string id="15376">Okay. I believe you. Thanks.</string>
  <string id="15377">Okay. I believe you. Thanks.</string>

  <string id="15379">Okay. I believe you. Thanks.</string>
  <string id="15380">Why are you so worried about Dexter? You&apos;d... you&apos;d think he was YOUR boyfriend!</string>
  <string id="15381">Why are you so worried about Dexter? You&apos;d... you&apos;d think he was YOUR boyfriend!</string>

  <string id="15385">Wow.</string>
  <string id="15386">Moving on.</string>
  <string id="15387">Hmph. I&apos;m just trying to protect you.</string>
  <string id="15388">Hmph. I&apos;m just trying to protect you.</string>

  <string id="15407">Leave me alone, Sonic! I was just being helpful!</string>

  <string id="15409">Leave me alone, Sonic! I was just being helpful!</string>
  <string id="15410">Leave me alone, Sonic! I was just being helpful!</string>
  <string id="15411">Leave me alone, Sonic! I was just being helpful!</string>
  <string id="15412">It does sound like a challenge.</string>
  <string id="15413">You don&apos;t need to worry about me, Amy.</string>
  <string id="15414">Everything will be fine, I promise.</string>
  <string id="15420">Does Dexter know you&apos;re so worried about me?</string>
  <string id="15446">Wow, did you come up with that by yourself?</string>
  <string id="15452">Sure, Sonic! Anytime!</string>
  <string id="15453">Sure, Sonic! Anytime!</string>
  <string id="15454">Sure, Sonic! Anytime!</string>
  <string id="15455">Sure, Sonic! Anytime!</string>
  <string id="15456">Sure, Sonic! Anytime!</string>
  <string id="15457">I guess so. We&apos;ll deal with it together.</string>

  <string id="15462">I&apos;m not being judgmental! Rouge is a thief! How can we trust her?</string>
  <string id="15463">I&apos;m not being judgmental! Rouge is a thief! How can we trust her?</string>

  <string id="15466">I&apos;m not being judgmental! Rouge is a thief! How can we trust her?</string>
  <string id="15467">She&apos;s our only contact with GUN, Amy. We have to try.</string>
  <string id="15468">Fine. Whatever.</string>
  <string id="15469">Well, fine. But when she gets her nasty Rouge-germs all over you, don&apos;t come crying to me!</string>
  <string id="15470">Well, fine. But when she gets her nasty Rouge-germs all over you, don&apos;t come crying to me!</string>

  <string id="15473">Well, fine. But when she gets her nasty Rouge-germs all over you, don&apos;t come crying to me!</string>
  <string id="15474">It&apos;s okay, Amy. I can handle Rouge.</string>
  <string id="15480">I wish it were different, Amy, but we have no choice.</string>
  <string id="15486">Don&apos;t be so judgmental, Amy.</string>
  <string id="15494">No one asked you to defend me, Amy.</string>
  <string id="15500">Yay! Thanks, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="15501">Yay! Thanks, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="15502">Yay! Thanks, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="15503">Yay! Thanks, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="15504">Yay! Thanks, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="15505">If he&apos;s your friend, Amy, then he&apos;s fine with me.</string>
  <string id="15513">Don&apos;t mention it.</string>
  <string id="15514">Don&apos;t mention it.</string>
  <string id="15515">Don&apos;t mention it.</string>
  <string id="15516">Don&apos;t mention it.</string>
  <string id="15517">Don&apos;t mention it.</string>
  <string id="15518">Sonic! You... Argh!</string>
  <string id="15519">Sonic! You... Argh!</string>
  <string id="15520">Sonic! You... Argh!</string>
  <string id="15521">Sonic! You... Argh!</string>
  <string id="15522">Sonic! You... Argh!</string>
  <string id="15523">You&apos;re right, Amy. Sorry, Knuckles.</string>
  <string id="15524">Whatever, Amy. People steal the Master Emerald all the time.</string>
  <string id="15529">I... I know. Thanks, Sonic. I feel better now.</string>
  <string id="15530">I... I know. Thanks, Sonic. I feel better now.</string>
  <string id="15531">I... I know. Thanks, Sonic. I feel better now.</string>
  <string id="15532">I... I know. Thanks, Sonic. I feel better now.</string>
  <string id="15533">I... I know. Thanks, Sonic. I feel better now.</string>
  <string id="15534">Argh! I am SO mad right now!</string>
  <string id="15535">Argh! I am SO mad right now!</string>
  <string id="15536">Argh! I am SO mad right now!</string>
  <string id="15537">Argh! I am SO mad right now!</string>
  <string id="15538">Argh! I am SO mad right now!</string>
  <string id="15539">What do we do now?</string>
  <string id="15545">Amy, stop being stupid!</string>
  <string id="15551">Why, he&apos;s my boyfriend! And he&apos;d be very unhappy to see us together, I tell you!</string>
  <string id="15552">Why, he&apos;s my boyfriend! And he&apos;d be very unhappy to see us together, I tell you!</string>
  <string id="15553">Why, he&apos;s my boyfriend! And he&apos;d be very unhappy to see us together, I tell you!</string>
  <string id="15554">Why, he&apos;s my boyfriend! And he&apos;d be very unhappy to see us together, I tell you!</string>
  <string id="15555">Why, he&apos;s my boyfriend! And he&apos;d be very unhappy to see us together, I tell you!</string>
  <string id="15556">Dexter, eh?</string>
  <string id="15557">Who cares about Dexter?</string>
  <string id="15563">Thank you, Sonic. Hmph.</string>
  <string id="15564">Thank you, Sonic. Hmph.</string>
  <string id="15565">Thank you, Sonic. Hmph.</string>
  <string id="15566">Thank you, Sonic. Hmph.</string>
  <string id="15567">Thank you, Sonic. Hmph.</string>
  <string id="15569">Amy&apos;s right. This better be good.</string>
  <string id="15576">But I also get the feeling you don&apos;t like me. It&apos;s... confusing, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="15577">So I wanted to ask you: Do you like me? Even a little bit? Or should I give up and leave you alone?</string>
  <string id="15578">I know. Just... Okay, I get it. </string>
  <string id="15579">I know we have a lot to do to get ready, so I won&apos;t keep you. I&apos;ll be ready to go soon.</string>
  <string id="15580">Do you mean it? I think I can forgive you if you do.</string>
  <string id="15581">Just don&apos;t do it again!</string>
  <string id="15582">And Sonic? Thanks!</string>
  <string id="15583">Fine! If that&apos;s how you want to be, then be that way!</string>
  <string id="15584">Just don&apos;t come crying to me when you... when.... Just don&apos;t come crying to me!</string>
  <string id="15585">Hmph!</string>
  <string id="15586">But I also get the feeling you don&apos;t like me. It&apos;s... confusing, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="15588">I just wanted to say thank you. I never thought you liked me before, so it&apos;s good to know you at least care a little bit!</string>
  <string id="15589">I... I see. Then you weren&apos;t.... Ah.</string>
  <string id="15590">Really? You mean it? I mean, of course I do!</string>
  <string id="15591">I better go get everything ready for the attack on Metropolis. Thanks, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="15592">Ha ha ha! Oh you!</string>
  <string id="15593">Ha ha ha! Oh you!</string>
  <string id="15596">I don&apos;t know how to say this, so I&apos;ll just come out with it: You&apos;ve been really nice to me lately.</string>
  <string id="15597">I don&apos;t know how to say this, so I&apos;ll just come out with it: You&apos;ve been really nice to me lately.</string>
  <string id="15598">I know you don&apos;t like me... the way I like you. I just hoped you liked me a little bit.</string>
  <string id="15601">I see. Then I won&apos;t bother you anymore.</string>
  <string id="15602">I... I have stuff to do. I....</string>
  <string id="15604">Well, you do. You make me so mad sometimes!</string>
  <string id="15605">But if you don&apos;t mean it, I guess I can forgive you. Only if you don&apos;t do it again!</string>
  <string id="15606">I know you don&apos;t like me... the way I like you. I just hoped you liked me a little bit.</string>
  <string id="15607">I know you don&apos;t like me... the way I like you. I just hoped you liked me a little bit.</string>
  <string id="15608">I&apos;m a little worried about trusting Eggman. I know we don&apos;t have much choice, but... he&apos;s Eggman, you know?</string>
  <string id="15609">I&apos;m sorry. I just can&apos;t believe he&apos;s reformed!</string>
  <string id="15610">Right. That&apos;s the smart thing to do. And if he slips up, wham!</string>
  <string id="15611">I guess you&apos;re right. Still, trusting our lives to our greatest enemy? It&apos;s crazy!</string>
  <string id="15612">No. We have to work with him, but I don&apos;t have to trust him. I never have to trust him!</string>
  <string id="15614">It&apos;s not personal, Amy. We&apos;re trying to save the world!</string>
  <string id="15617">I&apos;m sorry I&apos;ve been mean. Don&apos;t be mad!</string>
  <string id="15621">I&apos;m tired of this, Amy. Let&apos;s just do what we have to do!</string>
  <string id="15627">I like to be nice to all my friends, Amy.</string>
  <string id="15629">You deserve to be treated nicely, Amy.</string>
  <string id="15632">I&apos;m just doing it so you won&apos;t kill me!</string>
  <string id="15639">There&apos;s no time for this, Amy. We have stuff to do!</string>
  <string id="15644">Amy, don&apos;t be mad. I don&apos;t mean to make you upset.</string>
  <string id="15650">We&apos;ll keep an eye on him.</string>
  <string id="15652">I don&apos;t either, but we have no choice.</string>
  <string id="15654">We have to trust him.</string>
  <string id="15686">Hi, Sonic. What&apos;s up?</string>
  <string id="15687">I will be soon. It&apos;s just a lot to take in, you know!</string>
  <string id="15688">I know. I&apos;ll be there! I should go make sure everything&apos;s in order.</string>
  <string id="15689">I&apos;m pretty excited! I&apos;ve never been to an alternate dimension before. </string>
  <string id="15690">I know we&apos;re going to smash Ix, too. So that&apos;s a plus!</string>
  <string id="15692">Yes, please!</string>
  <string id="15694">Sure. I&apos;ll be ready soon!</string>
  <string id="15695">Are you ready to go?</string>
  <string id="15696">Well, we&apos;re leaving right away, so...</string>
  <string id="15697">How do you feel about our mission to the Twilight Cage?</string>
  <string id="15699">Okay. Talk to you later!</string>
  <string id="15702">Talk to you soon!</string>
  <string id="15703">Er, well. I meant it. Really!</string>
  <string id="15704">It is a little weird. I&apos;m not used to you being so nice to me!</string>
  <string id="15705">Really? Wow, okay!</string>
  <string id="15706">I&apos;m going to go... get ready. Talk to you soon, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="15711">I want to talk about what you said earlier.</string>
  <string id="15713">Well, get used to it!</string>
  <string id="15718">Thanks, Sonic. I just wanted to talk a moment.</string>
  <string id="15720">I was thinking, and I know we&apos;re going into some real danger today.</string>
  <string id="15721">We&apos;ve fought some dangerous foes, but these are echidnas from another dimension! With Gizoids!</string>
  <string id="15722">And you&apos;ve been so nice to me and all, and I... well, I....</string>
  <string id="15723">Okay. Whew.</string>
  <string id="15724">I just wanted you to know that I... I care for you, Sonic. And, well, some part of me thinks this could be the end.</string>
  <string id="15725">Some of the things you said to me before we came here... they gave me a little hope.</string>
  <string id="15726">I guess I wanted to know... do you like me, too? Do you feel anything for me at all?</string>
  <string id="15727">I--I see. Well, that makes sense, I guess. You&apos;re Sonic, after all. </string>
  <string id="15728">I guess we&apos;d better get back to work. We have a world to save, and all that.</string>
  <string id="15729">Okay. Well, I&apos;m going to... to go. I&apos;ll tell the others we&apos;re done.</string>
  <string id="15730">I&apos;ll see you later, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="15731">Just let me go, okay?</string>
  <string id="15732">But you just said... Argh!</string>
  <string id="15733">Make up your mind, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="15734">Do you have any idea what it&apos;s like to be pushed around by a boy you like? It&apos;s not fair!</string>
  <string id="15735">Grow up, Sonic. Just grow up!</string>
  <string id="15736">O-Okay, Sonic. I will....</string>
  <string id="15737">Really? You... Really?</string>
  <string id="15738">I--I didn&apos;t expect you to say that! It makes me so happy!</string>
  <string id="15739">I don&apos;t know what it all means, Sonic. But we&apos;re about to fight a 4000-year-old echidna chief, and....</string>
  <string id="15740">If we make it through this, we&apos;ll figure it out together!</string>
  <string id="15741">I... I understand, Sonic. There are more important things to worry about!</string>
  <string id="15742">I... I see. You&apos;re right. But it&apos;s good to know how you feel. </string>
  <string id="15747">Make this quick, Amy.</string>
  <string id="15751">Of course I do, Amy. I like all my friends.</string>
  <string id="15753">That we do.</string>
  <string id="15755">Wait, Amy.</string>
  <string id="15756">Sure, okay.</string>
  <string id="15757">No, Amy. I care for you a lot, okay?</string>
  <string id="15762">Yeah, fine. Go.</string>
  <string id="15763">Tell the others to come back in when you leave.</string>
  <string id="15764">Definitely, Amy. I care for you a lot.</string>
  <string id="15765">No, don&apos;t be silly.</string>
  <string id="15766">I know, Amy. I care about you, too.</string>
  <string id="15769">What is it?</string>
  <string id="15770">We can figure all this out after we win!</string>

  <string id="15907">Then maybe there&apos;s something wrong with it. As far as I know, Eggman hasn&apos;t been seen since you sank his Egg Carrier.</string>
  <string id="15908">I get tired of you accusing me of things I didn&apos;t do. </string>
  <string id="15909">If we&apos;re going to fight, let&apos;s just have it out now, Sonic. Enough words.</string>
  <string id="15910">I&apos;ll make this quick.</string>
  <string id="15911">I&apos;m out of here.</string>
  <string id="15913">Thanks, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="15914">Thanks, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="15915">Thanks, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="15916">Thanks, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="15917">Thanks, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="15918">I don&apos;t know, Sonic. Why would Shadow set off the tracker like this?</string>
  <string id="15919">Let&apos;s just go, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="15920">We can take him, but it&apos;d be a waste of time.</string>
  <string id="15921">Must it always be combat with you men?</string>
  <string id="15922">My face itches.</string>
  <string id="15923">Quite a team you have there, Sonic. No wonder you&apos;re so slow.</string>
  <string id="15924">If you insist. Let&apos;s see what you have left after your long vacation. </string>
  <string id="15925">We&apos;ve got a signal! It must be around here somewhere.</string>
  <string id="15926">Let&apos;s go check it out!</string>
  <string id="15927">Whew! That was pretty tough.</string>
  <string id="15928">Look, Sonic! That metal box on the leader&apos;s head; I think it&apos;s another Eggman device! Hm. I think I have all I need to... Yes!</string>
  <string id="15929">These fit together like so... and you clip this here... and connect this... Yay!</string>
  <string id="15930">The devices come together to form some kind of random pattern generator! We could probably use this to cancel a forcefield or unlock an electronic lock.</string>
  <string id="15934">We&apos;d better keep looking for Eggman. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="15935">Look, Sonic! That box on the leader&apos;s head is an Eggman device. That must be what turned these animals into robots!</string>
  <string id="15936">Look, Sonic! That box on the leader&apos;s head is an Eggman device. That must be what turned these animals into robots!</string>
  <string id="15937">Look, Sonic! That box on the leader&apos;s head is an Eggman device. That must be what turned these animals into robots!</string>
  <string id="15938">Look, Sonic! That box on the leader&apos;s head is an Eggman device. That must be what turned these animals into robots!</string>
  <string id="15939">That must be what our tracker detected!</string>
  <string id="15944">Hm. I can&apos;t tell what it&apos;s used for. Maybe I can examine it some other time. </string>
  <string id="15945">I think this is it, Sonic. The signal is getting much stronger!</string>
  <string id="15994">Look, Sonic! The GUN roadblock is gone!</string>
  <string id="15996">What was that?</string>
  <string id="15997">Shadow.</string>
  <string id="15998">Why would Shadow set off the Eggman tracker?</string>
  <string id="15999">I don&apos;t know, but I&apos;d like to find out.</string>
  <string id="16000">He went into Mystic Ruins. Maybe we should follow him.</string>
  <string id="16003">Let&apos;s check it out.</string>
  <string id="16008">Hello, Shadow.</string>
  <string id="16014">Tell us where to find Eggman.</string>
  <string id="16017">Well, you&apos;re up to SOMETHING.</string>
  <string id="16019">My pleasure.</string>
  <string id="16020">Fine. But we&apos;re watching you.</string>
  <string id="16021">What should we do, guys?</string>
  <string id="16022">Exactly, Amy!</string>
  <string id="16024">What do the rest of you think?</string>
  <string id="16030">I&apos;ll show you &quot;slow&quot;!</string>
  <string id="16109">What part?</string>
  <string id="16110">What part?</string>
  <string id="16111">Pick a part already!</string>
  <string id="16112">Start</string>
  <string id="16113">Part 2</string>
  <string id="16114">Part 3</string>
  <string id="16115">More options</string>
  <string id="16116">Part 4</string>
  <string id="16117">Part 5</string>
  <string id="16118">Part 6</string>
  <string id="16119">Even more options</string>
  <string id="16120">Part 7</string>
  <string id="16121">Part 8</string>
  <string id="16122">Part 9</string>
  <string id="16123">Changed my mind, go back.</string>
  <string id="16128">I bet Eggman would love to see this machine they had. It seems like some kind of signal transceiver.</string>
  <string id="16129">I bet Eggman would love to see this machine they had. It seems like some kind of signal transceiver.</string>
  <string id="16130">I don&apos;t know. I think this is what gave Croesus and his family so much trouble!</string>
  <string id="16131">Er... I, uh.... Okay, sorry, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="16132">I don&apos;t know. He might be interested in this.</string>
  <string id="16133">All right!</string>
  <string id="16134">That&apos;s enough about Eggman, Tails!</string>
  <string id="16136">Who cares what Eggman wants to see?</string>
  <string id="16138">You can tell him all about it when we get back.</string>
  <string id="16140">Light Slippers</string>
  <string id="16141">Increases player speed</string>
  <string id="16142">Listen to me, and listen well.</string>
  <string id="16143">I&apos;ll stick with you until we find Omega, Sonic. But don&apos;t expect me to join in on your group hugs and picnics.</string>
  <string id="16144">I&apos;ll be ready when it&apos;s time to go.</string>
  <string id="16145">I don&apos;t know. We&apos;ve lost touch. But knowing him, he likely detected Eggman robots in Metropolis and went there to destroy them.</string>
  <string id="16146">He&apos;s always wanted to be the toughest robot of all, and he&apos;ll take any chance to prove his strength.</string>
  <string id="16147">If those Marauders have done something to him, they have no idea what&apos;s coming to them.</string>
  <string id="16148">Omega&apos;s strong, but he&apos;s not invincible. And he&apos;s hardheaded enough to charge into danger without thinking.</string>
  <string id="16149">If something has happened to him, I will be very upset.</string>
  <string id="16150">The device I had when you found me was some kind of tracker, and it said he was in Metropolis.</string>
  <string id="16151">It couldn&apos;t tell me where, exactly. So either the device was useless, or Omega&apos;s not giving off a signal anymore.</string>
  <string id="16152">That worries me.</string>
  <string id="16153">Look, Sonic. I&apos;m not here to be nice to you. I&apos;m here because you&apos;re my best chance at finding Omega.</string>
  <string id="16154">That&apos;s all. I don&apos;t want to be part of your little team. I just want to get my friend back.</string>
  <string id="16155">The Marauders will get theirs in due time. Especially if I find out they&apos;re involved in Omega&apos;s disappearance. </string>
  <string id="16159">Tell me about what happened to E-123 Omega.</string>
  <string id="16161">We&apos;ll find him.</string>
  <string id="16163">Do you think he&apos;s in trouble?</string>
  <string id="16165">Where do you think he is?</string>
  <string id="16168">Why are you being like that?</string>
  <string id="16170">Fair enough. Be ready when the time comes.</string>
  <string id="16171">Don&apos;t you care about the Marauders?</string>
  <string id="16172">Tough Slippers</string>
  <string id="16175">Increases player speed</string>
  <string id="16177">Omega! Can you hear me?</string>
  <string id="16178">SYSTEMS COMING ONLINE -- E-123 OMEGA BEGINNING REACTIVATION PROTOCOL.</string>
  <string id="16179">If I had a nickel for every time I heard that....</string>
  <string id="16180">EGGMAN DETECTED. BEGINNING ANNIHILATION SEQUENCE.</string>
  <string id="16182">ORANGE FOREST CREATURE HAS GONE MAD. RECOMMEND IMMEDIATE DESTRUCTION.</string>
  <string id="16183">No, Omega. He&apos;s right. Eggman is helping Team Sonic against the Marauders.</string>
  <string id="16184">As hard as it is to believe.</string>
  <string id="16185">THERE IS NO REASON TO DOUBT SHADOW OR ROUGE. THERE IS NO REASON TO TRUST THE REST OF THESE MEATBAGS.</string>
  <string id="16186">Come with us, Omega. We&apos;re going to destroy the Marauders for what they did to you.</string>
  <string id="16187">YES. THEY WILL BE DESTROYED FOR WHAT THEY DID TO ME.</string>
  <string id="16188">Ugh. Again with the emotionless revenge. It just gets tired. </string>
  <string id="16189">Yes. We have much work to do!</string>
  <string id="16190">I CAME HERE TO DESTROY ALL OTHER EGGMAN ROBOTS. BUT I WAS SURROUNDED BY STRANGE CREATURES AND FORCED TO FLEE.</string>
  <string id="16191">THE COWARDS FOLLOWED ME. THEY MADE THEIR ROBOTS DISMANTLE ME WHILE I WAS HELPLESS.</string>
  <string id="16192">DISASSEMBLED BY INFERIOR MACHINES. IT WAS EMBARRASSING.</string>
  <string id="16193">YOUR EFFORTS WOULD BE BETTER SPENT ELSEWHERE.</string>
  <string id="16194">Omega!</string>
  <string id="16195">Oh, don&apos;t waste your time on this one. He&apos;s been a thorn in my side for years!</string>
  <string id="16196">Quiet, Eggman, or I promise you I&apos;ll--</string>
  <string id="16197">He&apos;s still functioning! Just heavily damaged. But I think I can...</string>
  <string id="16198">Yes! With the parts from those guardian robots, I can repair him!</string>
  <string id="16199">Do it.</string>
  <string id="16201">Wait! That&apos;s Omega!</string>
  <string id="16202">I knew it! Those Marauder goons. We have to--</string>
  <string id="16203">Later! Someone&apos;s coming!</string>
  <string id="16204">Good. I need to smash something.</string>
  <string id="16205">Shadow, this is Tails. I think we found Omega.</string>
  <string id="16206">Great. How is he?</string>
  <string id="16207">He looks.... Wait. There&apos;s something here.</string>
  <string id="16208">We&apos;ll talk later. Tails out!</string>
  <string id="16213">No! Omega, Eggman is on our side!</string>
  <string id="16218">Let&apos;s go! We have much to do!</string>
  <string id="16221">Let&apos;s go, team!</string>
  <string id="16223">What happened to you, Omega?</string>
  <string id="16227">I hope we can regain your trust!</string>
  <string id="16243">Sonic! Did you find Cheese?</string>
  <string id="16244">Cheese! I was worried sick!</string>
  <string id="16245">Thank you so much, Sonic! So much!</string>
  <string id="16246">Hey, are you guys doing something? You&apos;re saving the world again, aren&apos;t you?</string>
  <string id="16247">Would I?!</string>
  <string id="16248">You can always count on me, Sonic! Cream and Cheese are at your service!</string>
  <string id="16249">Let&apos;s get moving. We have work to do!</string>
  <string id="16250">Yay!</string>
  <string id="16251">Oh come on, Sonic! You and the team are all back together, running around the Green Hill Zone. What is it? Is Eggman back? Someone new?</string>
  <string id="16252">I want to help! It&apos;s the least I can do!</string>
  <string id="16253">Hooray!</string>
  <string id="16254">But... But Sonic....</string>
  <string id="16255">Sonic, Cream has helped us before, and she was just as helpful as anyone else!</string>
  <string id="16256">Yeah. If we run into any all-day lollypops, we&apos;ll need her expertise.</string>
  <string id="16257">Please? Can&apos;t I come with you? I promise I&apos;ll help! I promise!</string>
  <string id="16258">Oh... okay. </string>
  <string id="16259">Well, thanks for finding Cheese for me. Good luck with saving the world.</string>
  <string id="16260">Goodbye, Cream. Be safe, okay?</string>
  <string id="16261">Okay, Amy!</string>
  <string id="16262">Poo! Well, I&apos;ll keep looking. Maybe we&apos;ll find him soon!</string>
  <string id="16263">Sonic! You&apos;re really back!</string>
  <string id="16264">Cream! You poor thing, what are you doing out here?</string>
  <string id="16265">Oh, Amy, it&apos;s terrible! Cheese and I were out picking flowers when we were attacked! Angry animals came out of nowhere!</string>
  <string id="16266">We tried to run, but we got separated! I haven&apos;t been able to find Cheese since!</string>
  <string id="16268">I&apos;m so worried, Sonic. He&apos;s just a little Chao! I bet he&apos;s scared to death!</string>
  <string id="16269">Hooray!</string>
  <string id="16270">I want to keep looking on my own. Maybe if we split up, we can find him sooner!</string>
  <string id="16271">If you find him, please bring him to me! I&apos;ll hang out around here.</string>
  <string id="16272">Be careful, Cream!</string>
  <string id="16273">I will!</string>
  <string id="16274">Oh, you remember, Sonic. Cheese is Cream&apos;s pet Chao!</string>
  <string id="16275">He&apos;s my best friend!</string>
  <string id="16276">They go everywhere together. We have to find him!</string>
  <string id="16277">We got separated when I crossed the river, but he could be anywhere! He wouldn&apos;t go outside the Green Hill Zone, though, I&apos;m sure of that!</string>
  <string id="16278">Please find him, Sonic! </string>
  <string id="16279">Sure did!</string>
  <string id="16282">We sure are. Want to help?</string>
  <string id="16287">Er, no.... Why do you ask?</string>
  <string id="16288">Why do you want to know?</string>
  <string id="16290">Sure. Come with us, Cream.</string>
  <string id="16292">This is no job for a little kid.</string>
  <string id="16296">No. And that&apos;s my final answer.</string>
  <string id="16301">No, not yet.</string>
  <string id="16308">We&apos;ll find him, Cream.</string>
  <string id="16314">Who is Cheese?</string>
  <string id="16317">Where did you last see him?</string>
  <string id="16319">Use Item</string>
  <string id="16320">Equip Item</string>
  <string id="16321">Hey, Sonic. *sniff*</string>
  <string id="16322">Oh, nothing. I... I&apos;m just a little sad.</string>
  <string id="16323">Everything here is so weird and bad! Everyone is shooting at us or trying to capture us or being mean to us.</string>
  <string id="16324">I just... I wanna go home.</string>
  <string id="16325">I hope so. I want to see my mom.</string>
  <string id="16326">Thanks, Sonic. I feel a little better. I think I might go try to rest a little bit before we go out again.</string>
  <string id="16327">See you later!</string>
  <string id="16328">Yes it is! It&apos;s horrible! Everyone hates us here! </string>
  <string id="16329">And all the places are so weird and ugly! There&apos;s no grass or flowers or anything!</string>
  <string id="16330">Really? You think so?</string>
  <string id="16331">I guess so, if I look at it right. Like, I guess I&apos;ve never seen anything like the Kron. And Foreman Krag was pretty nice to us.</string>
  <string id="16332">Me too. I don&apos;t want to make everyone else sad.</string>
  <string id="16333">I think I&apos;ll go rest a little bit before we go out again.</string>
  <string id="16334">I&apos;m... I&apos;m okay. Just a little sad.</string>
  <string id="16335">Okay. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="16336">What&apos;s wrong, Cream?</string>
  <string id="16339">We&apos;ll be home soon, Cream.</string>
  <string id="16343">This place isn&apos;t so bad.</string>
  <string id="16345">This place can be beautiful, too.</string>
  <string id="16348">I&apos;m sorry, Cream.</string>
  <string id="16351">Hey, Cream. How are you?</string>
  <string id="16353">Goodbye!</string>
  <string id="16355">Froggy was just telling me that he hasn&apos;t seen his friend Norton in a long time. He&apos;s starting to get worried!</string>
  <string id="16356">Norton isn&apos;t a strong and mighty frog like Froggy. He&apos;s soft and mushy!</string>
  <string id="16357">Could we? Froggy would very much like that. He&apos;s so worried about Norton that he can&apos;t even speak!</string>
  <string id="16359">Yay!</string>
  <string id="16360">Don&apos;t worry, Froggy. We&apos;ll find him!</string>
  <string id="16361">I don&apos;t know. I&apos;m sure he&apos;s somewhere, though!</string>
  <string id="16362">I have an idea! We can look all over the place, everywhere! We&apos;re bound to find him!</string>
  <string id="16363">Oh, it&apos;s okay. It&apos;s his fault for going missing, anyway.</string>
  <string id="16364">Thanks anyway, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="16365">He looks like... hm. He&apos;s like, small, and green, and hoppy. Oh! Like a frog!</string>
  <string id="16366">Other than that, I&apos;m not too sure. Some kind of frog, yes sir.</string>
  <string id="16367">Well, not in so many words. More like he HINTED, I guess.</string>
  <string id="16368">But still, poor Norton!</string>
  <string id="16369">Okay, goodbye!</string>
  <string id="16370">Is your name Froggy? No. Your name is Sonic. So-nic.</string>
  <string id="16371">He&apos;s my best friend! We&apos;ve had all sorts of adventures. I just don&apos;t remember them all.</string>
  <string id="16373">Should we go look for him?</string>
  <string id="16375">We&apos;ll find him.</string>
  <string id="16378">Where would he be?</string>
  <string id="16380">There&apos;s no time, Big. Sorry.</string>
  <string id="16382">What does he look like?</string>
  <string id="16384">Your frog told you that his friend is missing?</string>
  <string id="16386">That&apos;s too bad. Well, good talking to you, Big.</string>
  <string id="16387">Are you talking to me?</string>
  <string id="16389">Who is Froggy?</string>
  <string id="16391">Norton! I&apos;m so glad you&apos;re safe. Froggy was worried!</string>
  <string id="16393">Thanks, Sonic. Froggy feels much better now!</string>
  <string id="16394">Norton!</string>
  <string id="16395">Oh, hey there, Gally!</string>
  <string id="16396">You shouldn&apos;t be out so late, Gally. Your mother would be very cross!</string>
  <string id="16397">We should keep looking. Norton must be so lonely!</string>
  <string id="16398">No, you&apos;re not Norton. You&apos;re Mr. Billywick!</string>
  <string id="16399">You crazy scamp! Go back to your family!</string>
  <string id="16400">Silly Mr. Billywick. Always out on the town!</string>
  <string id="16401">Norton&apos;s still out there, Sonic. We have to find him!</string>
  <string id="16402">Oh, wait. That&apos;s not Norton. That&apos;s Mrs. Stevens!</string>
  <string id="16403">Sorry, Mrs. Stevens. We won&apos;t bother you again!</string>
  <string id="16404">That wasn&apos;t him, Sonic. He must still be out there!</string>
  <string id="16417">Hurry up, I don&apos;t have all day.</string>
  <string id="16418">More options</string>
  <string id="16419">Skip to Chapter 6</string>
  <string id="16420">More options</string>
  <string id="16441">Hey darlin&apos;. This is it, I guess.</string>
  <string id="16442">Thanks so much for helping me with that little GUN mission. You&apos;re a sweetheart.</string>
  <string id="16443">I guess if we&apos;re going to be fighting to the death, I&apos;d better go put my face on, eh?</string>
  <string id="16444">You&apos;ll get us through this, Sonic. I know you will.</string>
  <string id="16445">Got something for me?</string>
  <string id="16446">Hey there, Big Blue. Got a moment?</string>
  <string id="16447">I have a secret, darlin&apos;. And it&apos;s just for you and me.</string>
  <string id="16448">Before we left home, I got a message from GUN. They have a little mission for me out here.</string>
  <string id="16449">They&apos;re curious about the Nocturnus and their technology. They want me to bring some back to them.</string>
  <string id="16450">They saw how easily the Nocturnus took out Knuckles and stole the Chaos Emeralds. They want some of that power for themselves.</string>
  <string id="16451">To defend the world, of course.</string>
  <string id="16452">I&apos;m sure the Nocturnus Clan soldiers will leave Nocturnus Tech behind when we defeat them in combat.</string>
  <string id="16455">Thanks, Big Blue. You really know how to help a girl out.</string>
  <string id="16456">Just come talk to me when you have more Nocturnus Tech. I&apos;ll make it worth your while!</string>
  <string id="16459">Oh, whatever. It&apos;s not like we&apos;re getting it for Eggman or something. It&apos;s just GUN.</string>
  <string id="16460">Fine. We&apos;ll talk later, I suppose.</string>
  <string id="16461">You ready to fight when the time comes?</string>
  <string id="16465">Sure. What&apos;s up?</string>
  <string id="16468">How do we do that?</string>
  <string id="16469">Why do they want Nocturnus technology?</string>
  <string id="16472">Sounds easy enough. Let&apos;s do it.</string>
  <string id="16479">I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s such a good idea.</string>
  <string id="16481">Not right now.</string>
  <string id="16497">You&apos;re that thing I&apos;ve seen running around! It had the same spiky hair as you!</string>
  <string id="16498">&quot;Someone like you&quot;? No, it was you. I recognize that pointy head anywhere. You were running around like a shadow, but when I&apos;d look again, you were gone.</string>
  <string id="16499">Exactly. Just about the strangest thing.</string>
  <string id="16500">Right. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s not. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve never run around like a shadow in your life. Liar.</string>
  <string id="16501">No, it was you. I recognize that pointy head anywhere. You were running around like a shadow, but when I&apos;d look again, you were gone.</string>
  <string id="16503">Thing? You mean the Night Stalker?</string>
  <string id="16504">You saw someone like me running around, too?</string>
  <string id="16505">You saw someone like me running around?</string>
  <string id="16506">We just want to ask about the Night Stalker.</string>
  <string id="16507">&quot;Like a Shadow,&quot; huh?</string>
  <string id="16508">That&apos;s not me.</string>
  <string id="16509">I haven&apos;t been running around anywhere.</string>
  <string id="16511">Have we met? You look familiar.</string>
  <string id="16512">Yes! I saw you running through here earlier. You were really moving. And when I looked again, you were gone... like a shadow!</string>
  <string id="16513">Ha! Impressive, that, my friend! We could use more of that sort of thing, I say!</string>
  <string id="16514">I did! Made quite a fuss, too. You should be more careful where you go around here. In times like these, you never know what could happen!</string>
  <string id="16515">Just like one. Most impressive. With more people like you, I wouldn&apos;t have to sell these charms!</string>
  <string id="16516">No? Pity. With more people like that, I wouldn&apos;t have to sell these charms!</string>
  <string id="16520">You saw someone like me running around here?</string>
  <string id="16521">We should be going.</string>
  <string id="16522">You saw someone like me running around, too?</string>
  <string id="16523">&quot;Like a Shadow&quot;, you say?</string>
  <string id="16524">Why are you selling charms?</string>
  <string id="16525">That wasn&apos;t me.</string>
  <string id="16527">Oh, it&apos;s you! I saw you whizzing by here earlier. You may be fast, but even your speed won&apos;t help if the guards catch you asking questions!</string>
  <string id="16528">It had to be you. It looked like a shadow, but with spiky hair like yours. Who else could it be?</string>
  <string id="16530">You&apos;ve seen me here before?</string>
  <string id="16531">&quot;Like a Shadow.&quot; Who could it be, indeed.</string>
  <string id="16532">You&apos;ve seen someone like me around, too?</string>
  <string id="16533">That wasn&apos;t me.</string>
  <string id="16535">We have seennn you beforrre, streakinnng through like a shadow....</string>
  <string id="16536">The hair, the shoesss... definnnitely you....</string>

  <string id="16540">You&apos;ve seen me before?</string>
  <string id="16541">Not this again.</string>
  <string id="16542">That wasn&apos;t me.</string>

  <string id="16577">(You look familiar. Oh yes! I saw you run through here not too long ago. I recognize the spikes on your head.)</string>
  <string id="16578">(I&apos;ve never seen anyone move that fast. You almost seemed to disappear!)</string>
  <string id="16579">(I certainly did. There can&apos;t be TWO creatures on Voxai Beta that look like you.)</string>
  <string id="16580">(How can I help you?)</string>
  <string id="16581">(Exactly. I thought it was peculiar.)</string>
  <string id="16582">(No, I&apos;m sure it was. There can&apos;t be TWO creatures on Voxai Beta that look like you.</string>

  <string id="16601">I&apos;m fine. Don&apos;t you have something you could be doing?</string>
  <string id="16602">Then get to it. Ix isn&apos;t going to destroy himself.</string>
  <string id="16603">I&apos;m always ready.</string>
  <string id="16604">So do I.</string>
  <string id="16605">Of course we are. Why would I want to see Ix conquer our world?</string>
  <string id="16606">Don&apos;t give me a hard time, Sonic. I&apos;m here to help.</string>
  <string id="16607">What&apos;s that supposed to mean?</string>
  <string id="16609">Oh, I see. If I&apos;m not busy running around with Team Sonic, I have to sit here and twiddle my thumbs while Ix moves on our world. Right?</string>
  <string id="16610">No thanks, Sonic. I&apos;ll do my own thing, and you&apos;ll stay out of my way.</string>
  <string id="16611">I&apos;m here to bring down Ix, same as you. I&apos;m ready for anything that will bring him down.</string>
  <string id="16612">Just stop hassling me and get it done.</string>
  <string id="16613">Because I can&apos;t bear to sit here and do nothing. We&apos;re here for a reason, and I won&apos;t be held back by your idiotic rules.</string>
  <string id="16614">You do what you want, Sonic. But I&apos;m helping in my way.</string>
  <string id="16615">Hmph. Fine. You&apos;re in charge, Sonic. And when we fail, it&apos;s on your head.</string>
  <string id="16616">No pressure, hero.</string>
  <string id="16617">Whatever.</string>
  <string id="16618">I just wanted to see how you&apos;re doing.</string>
  <string id="16619">Yeah. I have to defeat Ix.</string>
  <string id="16620">Just be ready if we need you.</string>
  <string id="16622">I have work to do.</string>
  <string id="16623">Watch it, Shadow. We&apos;re on the same side here.</string>
  <string id="16625">You&apos;ve been really busy lately, haven&apos;t you?</string>
  <string id="16629">Fine. Just be ready if we need you.</string>
  <string id="16631">Why must you always work alone?</string>
  <string id="16633">This stops now, Shadow. I have to be able to trust you.</string>

  <string id="16650">Well, I think he might be proud.</string>
  <string id="16651">But... He... All right, Sonic. I understand.</string>
  <string id="16652">Anyway, now that it&apos;s destroyed, it can&apos;t poison the pools with its exhaust anymore!</string>
  <string id="16669">You can tell him when we get back.</string>
  <string id="16670">Who cares?</string>
  <string id="16672">That&apos;s enough about Eggman, Tails.</string>

  <string id="16699">Sonic! It looks like Haniman had a Precursor tablet in his shop!</string>
  <string id="16700">Sonic! It looks like there&apos;s some kind of strange tablet here in Haniman&apos;s store!</string>
  <string id="16701">Weird writing. I wonder where it came from?</string>
  <string id="16702">Maybe someone used it as payment for a Night Stalker charm.</string>
  <string id="16703">Maybe if we go back to the Kron colony, Nestor can help us figure out what it says!</string>
  <string id="16704">I can&apos;t make out what it says. Maybe we can find someone who can!</string>
  <string id="16705">I was out of a job! The military said they had no use for a &quot;simple&quot; holo-emitter, so I decided to show them!</string>
  <string id="16706">And I figured I could make some money on the side selling these trinkets to gullible citizens. It was a perfect plan!</string>
  <string id="16707">I would have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn&apos;t for you meddling heroes!</string>
  <string id="16710">Ha! Eggman and I could have built a much better machine!</string>
  <string id="16711">Ha! Eggman and I could have built a much better machine!</string>
  <string id="16712">I just thought.... Never mind.</string>
  <string id="16713">Sorry, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="16714">You have no chance, offworlder. You have no evidence!</string>
  <string id="16716">Heh. Don&apos;t we?</string>
  <string id="16721">I guess your Night Stalker is shut down for good.</string>
  <string id="16731">Why did you do it, Haniman?</string>
  <string id="16735">I think now you&apos;ll need the protective charms!</string>
  <string id="16736">No doubt. It wasn&apos;t very convincing.</string>
  <string id="16737">What does Eggman have to do with this?</string>
  <string id="16739">That&apos;s enough about Eggman, Tails.</string>
  <string id="16743">Ha! Eggman and I could have built a much better machine!</string>

  <string id="16749">That&apos;s enough about Eggman, Tails.</string>
  <string id="16752">It certainly seemed like one.</string>
  <string id="16753">We&apos;ve always had Gizoids. Lord Ix must really value this factory if he sent Gizoids to guard it.</string>
  <string id="16756">Wow. I wish Eggman were here to see this!</string>
  <string id="16757">Wow. I wish Eggman were here to see this!</string>
  <string id="16758">He was interested in Emerl, the Gizoid that we met a while back. He&apos;d love to see more Gizoids in action.</string>
  <string id="16759">Though I don&apos;t think he&apos;d like to fight them!</string>
  <string id="16760">Sure. Sorry, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="16762">Wow! Too bad Eggman had to miss this!</string>
  <string id="16766">We&apos;ll have to be careful, team.</string>
  <string id="16767">Why would Eggman want to see this?</string>

  <string id="16849">I&apos;m not sure. I... I don&apos;t really know what needs to be done.</string>
  <string id="16850">I&apos;m... okay. Look, Sonic. I need to talk about something, so just listen, okay?</string>
  <string id="16851">I&apos;m not sure we&apos;re doing the right thing, going after Ix.</string>

  <string id="16855">No, it&apos;s not. But I keep thinking that maybe we can talk to him. Maybe we can redeem him.</string>
  <string id="16856">He wasn&apos;t always this power-mad villain, not according to the stories. At least, no more than Pachacamac was, and he was the chief of my own clan.</string>

  <string id="17075">Oh! Oh my! It&apos;s Eggman!</string>
  <string id="17076">Don&apos;t worry, sir! He&apos;s with us!</string>
  <string id="17077">Oh, well. I suppose if you have him under control....</string>

  <string id="17127">Look, Sonic. The robot&apos;s head... it&apos;s an Eggman device!</string>
  <string id="17128">That must be what our tracker detected!</string>
  <string id="17129">Hm. I can&apos;t tell what it&apos;s used for. Maybe I can examine it some other time. </string>

  <string id="17781">Is everyone ready to get the plan underway?</string>
  <string id="17784">Well then, I guess we know what we have to do.</string>
  <string id="17785">Let me know as soon as you&apos;re ready to go. Keep in mind, once we signal the Zoah, we won&apos;t have time to do anything but head straight for Nocturne.</string>
  <string id="17786">Sonic, could I speak with you alone for a bit?</string>
  <string id="17787">Um, okay. I guess.</string>
  <string id="17788">Great!</string>
  <string id="17789">Hey everyone! Could Sonic and I have a little privacy here?</string>
  <string id="17790">What for?</string>
  <string id="17791">Yeah, you can talk in front of us.</string>
  <string id="17792">I don&apos;t understand what&apos;s so--</string>
  <string id="17793">I said GET OUT!</string>
  <string id="17794">....</string>
  <string id="17795">....</string>
  <string id="17796">....</string>
  <string id="17797">Er, sure. Just a few minutes, though. We have stuff to do!</string>
  <string id="17798">I&apos;ll tell you when we&apos;re alone.</string>
  <string id="17799">If there&apos;s anything we need to finish up before we go, we&apos;d better do it now!</string>
  <string id="17800">All right!</string>
  <string id="17801"> Strap in, everyone! It&apos;s time!</string>
  <string id="17802">Tails to Zoah Command. Come in, Zoah Command!</string>
  <string id="17803">This is Zoah Command, over.</string>
  <string id="17804">We&apos;re ready to go!</string>
  <string id="17805">Affirmative. Fire rocket cannon on my mark. Three... Two... One... Mark!</string>
  <string id="17808">Now, Tails! Go!</string>
  <string id="17810">It&apos;s closing!</string>
  <string id="17811">Faster!</string>
  <string id="17812">I can&apos;t!</string>
  <string id="17814">We&apos;re not going to make it! Turn back!</string>
  <string id="17815">I... can&apos;t....</string>
  <string id="17816">Tails! We can do this. We have to!</string>
  <string id="17817">I... I&apos;ll try....</string>
  <string id="17819">We did it!</string>
  <string id="17820">Yay!</string>
  <string id="17821">Find a place to land, Tails... and quickly!</string>
  <string id="17822">Right! Everyone, hold on!</string>
  <string id="17824">Right. We&apos;d better be sure before we go.</string>
  <string id="17825">This could be it, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="17827">All we have to do is signal the Zoah when we&apos;re ready. Just let me know, and I&apos;ll tell them to fire their cannon.</string>
  <string id="17828">Then we wait, and we storm through the hole in the repulsor field as soon as the N&apos;rrgal have chewed their way through.</string>
  <string id="17829">It sounds easy when you put it that way.</string>
  <string id="17830">It&apos;s definitely not going to be easy. But we have to win. We have to stop Ix.</string>
  <string id="17831">I think we are. We&apos;ve been through a lot since you came back, Sonic, but I think we can do this.</string>
  <string id="17832">Hm.</string>
  <string id="17833">Something wrong, Knuckles?</string>
  <string id="17834">No. Nothing. I&apos;m ready.</string>
  <string id="17835">So... What do we do next?</string>
  <string id="17836">We have all of the Chaos Emeralds I detected! But there are still two more Emeralds missing!</string>
  <string id="17837">Lord Ix has probably hidden the other Emeralds on Nocturne. That would explain why we never detected them.</string>
  <string id="17838">We can&apos;t. I&apos;m sorry. I&apos;m afraid the quest is over. </string>
  <string id="17839">There&apos;s a repulsor field around Nocturne. Nothing gets through that field without Lord Ix&apos;s permission. The field would even block your sensors.</string>
  <string id="17841">We have to get through. Ix has the Master Emerald in there, I can feel it!</string>
  <string id="17842">Hey! That&apos;s a great idea!</string>
  <string id="17843">What if we called everyone together to talk about a master plan?</string>
  <string id="17844">The N&apos;rrgal and Zoah would never work together.</string>
  <string id="17845">And Thebes has only been a leader for a short time. How could he help?</string>
  <string id="17846">Right! I&apos;ll call them.</string>
  <string id="17848">Called have you the mighty Foreman Krag.</string>
  <string id="17850">Help I will to the best of my ability.</string>
  <string id="17852">Provide I will a meeting place. Come you to my chamber when ready you are.</string>
  <string id="17853">Good. Let me call the others!</string>
  <string id="17854">Punching in the Kron, Zoah, and N&apos;rrgal frequencies!</string>
  <string id="17855">Make it quick.</string>
  <string id="17856">(What can the Voxai do for you?)</string>
  <string id="17857">What do you nnneed...?</string>
  <string id="17858">Foreman Krag has set aside a meeting place for us!</string>
  <string id="17859">(Of course. We will meet you there.)</string>
  <string id="17860">Ha! You&apos;re either brave or suicidal. But I&apos;ll be there.</string>
  <string id="17861">We will attennnd....</string>
  <string id="17864">We&apos;re really doing this, aren&apos;t we?</string>
  <string id="17865">We can&apos;t fail. The Master Emerald is at stake.</string>
  <string id="17866">Then we need to get to the Kron Colony and get things started!</string>
  <string id="17867">Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="17868">Then we have no choice. We have to try!</string>
  <string id="17869">We could give Big some ice cream!</string>
  <string id="17870">...</string>
  <string id="17871">...</string>
  <string id="17872">...</string>
  <string id="17873">... What?</string>
  <string id="17874">We can&apos;t give up now! We can&apos;t just let Ix win!</string>
  <string id="17875">We did it! We got the Chaos Emeralds back from the Voxai!</string>
  <string id="17876">I hope everything goes okay for Thebes. He seemed a little bit over his head.</string>
  <string id="17877">He&apos;ll be fine. I know it.</string>
  <string id="17878">What do we do now?</string>
  <string id="17880">I detected Chaos Emeralds in Sector Scylla. We should look there next.</string>
  <string id="17881">Just choose our destination on the travel map whenever you&apos;re ready to go!</string>
  <string id="17882">I detected Chaos Emeralds in Sector Charyb. We should look there next.</string>
  <string id="17883">We did it! I can&apos;t believe we did it!</string>
  <string id="17884">Do you think the N&apos;rrgal and Zoah will be friends?</string>
  <string id="17885">I hope so! All that fighting wasn&apos;t solving anything for them!</string>
  <string id="18276">Not yet. I&apos;ll let you know when we&apos;re ready.</string>
  <string id="18278">Then let&apos;s do it.</string>
  <string id="18280">There&apos;s no time. We have to get going!</string>
  <string id="18282">Uh, sure, Amy.</string>
  <string id="18293">What about?</string>
  <string id="18294">Okay, then. Let&apos;s talk.</string>
  <string id="18295">I&apos;m ready. Let&apos;s start the attack!</string>
  <string id="18320">Good to know. I&apos;ll tell you when I&apos;m ready.</string>
  <string id="18325">What do we have to do, exactly?</string>
  <string id="18329">I&apos;ll tell you when I&apos;m ready.</string>
  <string id="18330">Are you all ready for this?</string>
  <string id="18336">Then let&apos;s go to Nocturne!</string>
  <string id="18340">Maybe our new friends can help.</string>
  <string id="18344">Let&apos;s get our new friends together.</string>
  <string id="18347">We need your help. We&apos;re about to try to invade Nocturne.</string>
  <string id="18356">We&apos;re going to attack Nocturne. If you want to help, meet us on the Kron Colony</string>
  <string id="18367">They have to work together, or we&apos;re all doomed.</string>
  <string id="18368">Anyone have a better idea?</string>
  <string id="18373">So what do we do?</string>
  <string id="18374">It looks bleak, doesn&apos;t it?</string>
  <string id="18376">How do we get to Nocturne?</string>
  <string id="18377">Why wouldn&apos;t we detect them?</string>
  <string id="18381">We have to find the other four Chaos Emeralds before we can take on Ix.</string>

  <string id="18784">Right, and I guess he&apos;s better with us than against us.</string>
  <string id="18785">Me either. I&apos;ll keep an eye on him!</string>
  <string id="18786">Could be. It&apos;s tough to believe, though.</string>

  <string id="18789">We have to be ready for anything.</string>
  <string id="18791">I&apos;m not so sure about that.</string>
  <string id="18793">Maybe he&apos;s really changed this time.</string>
  <string id="18797">I&apos;ll be ready when it&apos;s time to go.</string>
  <string id="18869">There are no items to display.</string>
  <string id="18870">Skip to Chapter 10</string>
  <string id="18871">What part?</string>
  <string id="18872">Start</string>
  <string id="18873">Nocturne start</string>
  <string id="18874">Never mind, go back.</string>
  <string id="18891">While he was away exploring and solving problems elsewhere, Sonic received a message from Tails: Knuckles is missing!&#13;
&#13;
Tails asked for Sonic&apos;s help to track the Marauders, the mysterious villains who took Knuckles. Sonic returned from afar to help find Knuckles and bring these Marauders to justice!&#13;
&#13;
</string>
  <string id="18892">While he was away exploring and solving problems elsewhere, Sonic received a message from Tails: Knuckles is missing! Sonic returned to Green Hill Zone, where his quest to find Knuckles would begin.&#13;
&#13;
After meeting up with Amy Rose, Sonic headed off to team up with Tails and find out more about the Marauder plot.</string>
  <string id="18893">While he was away exploring and solving problems elsewhere, Sonic received a message from Tails: Knuckles is missing, kidnapped by a mysterious group known as the Marauders!&#13;
&#13;
Armed with the knowledge that the Marauders have also been stealing Chaos Emeralds, Sonic and friends decided to stop at GUN Headquarters and see what they can find out about Knuckles&apos; disappearance.&#13;
</string>
  <string id="18894">The search for Knuckles is on!&#13;
&#13;
Sonic and friends learned that the Marauders have been operating out of several of Eggman&apos;s abandoned hideouts throughout Green Hill Zone and Central City. This only brought up more questions. Who are the Marauders? Could Eggman be involved in Knuckles&apos; disappearance?</string>
  <string id="18895">The search for Knuckles is on!&#13;
&#13;
After exploring all four of Eggman&apos;s abandoned hideouts, the team discovered enough Marauder communicators for Tails to invent a device that could detect the source of the Marauders&apos; communications. With this device, Tails pinpointed a fifth secret location, possibly the place where the Marauders were keeping Knuckles!</string>
  <string id="18896">With Knuckles found, the team set out for Angel Island to stop the Marauders before they can steal the Master Emerald. Unfortunately, when the team finally escaped the ruins in which Knuckles was held, they discovered a chilling fact: Angel Island was gone!&#13;
&#13;
Convinced that this was Eggman&apos;s doing, the team set out to find their old nemesis and stop him before his plans could endanger all of the world!</string>
  <string id="18897">Worried that Eggman might be behind the actions of the mysterious Marauders, Sonic and friends decided to track down their old nemesis and make him answer for his crimes. When they found him, however, he claimed to be reformed. What&apos;s more, he&apos;s willing to help Sonic and friends find and defeat the Marauders!&#13;
&#13;
With Eggman&apos;s help, the team tracked Angel Island&apos;s vector and discovered that the Marauders were somehow moving the island into the airspace over Metropolis! They decided to travel to Metropolis to stop the Marauders, but first they had to find a way into Eggman&apos;s ruined fortress.</string>
  <string id="18898">With Angel Island missing and believed to be floating toward Metropolis, Sonic and friends (including a &quot;reformed&quot; Eggman) traveled to Blue Ridge Zone, where the entrance to Metropolis is located. Unfortunately, they ran into ever stronger Marauder interference, including the Marauders&apos; leader, a mysterious echidna named Shade!&#13;
&#13;
As Shade and her so-called Nocturnus Clan escaped, they sealed shut the entrance to Metropolis, forcing the team to find another way inside. Thankfully, Eggman knew a secret entrance via Metropolis&apos; sewer system.</string>
  <string id="18899">With Angel Island floating into place in the skies of Metropolis, Sonic and his friends set out to stop Shade the Echidna and her mysterious Nocturnus Clan from landing on Angel Island and stealing the Master Emerald. &#13;
&#13;
After entering Metropolis through the ruined sewer system, the team had to fight their way through the city&apos;s Marauder-infested ruins and up to Angel Island. They must stop the Nocturnus Clan at all costs!</string>
  <string id="18900">After fighting their way through some tough opposition, Sonic and his team landed on Angel Island top stop the Nocturnus Clan from stealing the Master Emerald. Then the Nocturnus leader, a mysterious robed echidna, commanded his Marauder minions to destroy Sonic&apos;s team!&#13;
&#13;
Meanwhile, Tails and Eggman led a team in Metropolis to find a way to squash the Nocturnus Clan. They invented the Beam Cannon, which would teleport the Nocturnus back to the dimension from whence they came! Now the two teams must come together and focus their efforts to destroy the Nocturnus Clan!</string>
  <string id="18901">The Story So Far</string>
  <string id="18914">Things look bad for our heroes. The evil Ix, leader of the Nocturnus Clan, escaped into an alternate dimension with the Master Emerald. Without the power of the Master Emerald, Angel Island came crashing down into the middle of Eggman&apos;s ruined city, Metropolis! Just then, a massive dark wormhole blackened the sky above!&#13;
&#13;
But all is not lost. If the heroes could find some way to follow Ix through the wormhole and retrieve the Master Emerald, the day could be saved!</string>
  <string id="18915">With a massive dark wormhole blotting out the sky over Metropolis, Sonic and his friends sought a way to travel to the Twilight Cage, where Ix had taken the Master Emerald. Sonic teamed up with Ix&apos;s former lieutenant, Shade, who turned against Ix when she learned his plans involve conquering the world. &#13;
&#13;
Sonic, Shade, and the rest of the team set out to restore electrical power to Metropolis while Eggman and Tails worked on designs for an interdimensional spaceship. With luck, they could build the ship and launch it into the wormhole before it&apos;s too late.</string>

Sonic teamed up with Ix&apos;s former lieutenant, Shade, who turned against Ix when she learned his plans involve conquering the world. &#13;
&#13;
Sonic, Shade, and the rest of the team set out to retrieve an important part from Eggman&apos;s Hazard Vault while Eggman and Tails worked on designs for an interdimensional spaceship. With luck, they could build the ship and launch it into the wormhole before too late.</string>
  <string id="18917">After the Nocturnus Clan, led by the powerful Lord Ix, captured the Master Emerald and carried it through a massive wormhole in the sky, Sonic and friends built an interdimensional spaceship to follow them. The heroes found themselves in the Twilight Cage, a strange dimension where the Nocturnus Clan reigns supreme. &#13;
&#13;
With the Blue Cyclone damaged by the trip through the wormhole, Sonic and his friends were forced to crash-land on the nearest landmass, a planetoid that is home to a race known as the Kron. Interestingly, Tails detected a Chaos Emerald on the Kron Colony. If the team could recover that Emerald, he could use it to get the Cyclone back into shape.</string>

  <string id="18992">When the evil Lord Ix stole the Master Emerald from Angel Island, Sonic and his friends chased him into another dimension on an interdimensional spaceship. Unfortunately, the Cyclone lost power entering the wormhole and was forced to crash land on a nearby planetoid: the rocky homeworld of the Kron.&#13;
&#13;
Sonic and friends discovered that the Kron were conquered and enslaved by Lord Ix and the Nocturnus Clan, and that the stone-like Kron sought a way out from under Ix&apos;s heel. The team set off to meet with Foreman Krag, the Kron leader, to find out how they could help.</string>

&#13;
Sonic and friends discovered that the Kron were conquered and enslaved by Lord Ix and the Nocturnus Clan, and that the stone-like Kron sought a way out from under Ix&apos;s heel. According to Foreman Krag, the Kron leader, Ix took control of the Kron factory and barred the Kron from entering. If Sonic and friends could retake the factory, Foreman Krag would give Sonic the Chaos Emerald he received from Ix.</string>

Unfortunately, the Cyclone lost power entering the wormhole and was forced to crash land on a nearby planetoid: the rocky homeworld of the Kron.&#13;
&#13;
With the factory freed and returned to Kron control, Sonic and friends have recovered the first of the stolen Chaos Emeralds and returned power to the Cyclone. They couldn&apos;t rest on their laurels, however; six Chaos Emeralds remained, and they still had to take the Master Emerald from the clutches of Ix himself.</string>
  <string id="18995">When the evil Lord Ix stole the Master Emerald from Angel Island, Sonic and his friends chased him into another dimension. First they had to help the stone-like Kron free themselves from Ix&apos;s rule. Once the Kron were freed, Sonic&apos;s new allies gave the team the first of the stolen Chaos Emeralds to help them against Ix and his Nocturnus Clan.&#13;
&#13;
Now faced with the open expanses of the vast Twilight Cage, the team was faced with a difficult challenge: reclaim the remaining six Chaos Emeralds, and prepare for the battle against Ix!</string>
  <string id="18996">When the evil Lord Ix stole the Master Emerald from Angel Island, Sonic and his friends chased him into another dimension. After recovering the first Chaos Emerald from the stone-like Kron, the team was forced to scour the Twilight Cage for signs of the remaining six Emeralds.&#13;

With Chaos Emeralds detected in Sector Charyb, the team decided to travel to the colony of the psychic Voxai. With luck, the Voxai would welcome them on their quest to stop Ix.</string>
  <string id="18997">When the evil Lord Ix stole the Master Emerald from Angel Island, Sonic and his friends chased him into another dimension.

The team decided to travel to Sector Scylla, home to the warlike Zoah and the relentless N&apos;rrgal, hoping to find more of the stolen Chaos Emeralds. With luck, they could track down the Emeralds without getting involved in the aliens&apos; ongoing cold war.</string>

Not long after landing on the N&apos;rrgal Colony, the Cyclone was rendered immobile, its energy devoured by N&apos;rrgal drones. The team was arrested and taken before the N&apos;rrgal Queen. The Queen offered Sonic a deal: steal the hated Zoah&apos;s secret weapon and bring it back to the N&apos;rrgal in exchange for the team&apos;s freedom.</string>

&#13;
Upon reaching the Zoah Colony, they were attacked by a Zoah patrol, who accused them of being N&apos;rrgal spies. Now the team was faced with a difficult task: infiltrate the tight security of the Zoah, get past their powerful soldiers, and steal their secret weapon for the N&apos;rrgal!</string>

With the Zoah&apos;s secret weapon (a Chaos Emerald!) in hand, the team returned to the N&apos;rrgal Colony, where the N&apos;rrgal Queen gave them their freedom and the Chaos Emerald Ix had gifted to the N&apos;rrgal. Because Ix gave an Emerald to both the N&apos;rrgal and to their hated enemies, the N&apos;rrgal Queen promised to aid Sonic against Ix when the time came.</string>

When they landed on Voxai Colony Beta, they found that no Voxai would speak to them. The strange aliens who lived there seemed busy or distracted, and no one even seemed to notice Sonic and his friends. Perhaps this would make the search for the Chaos Emeralds easier.</string>

&#13;
Soon after landing on Voxai Colony Beta, the team was approached by a Voxai named Thebes. He seemed agitated, but was happy to find the team, and he asked for Sonic&apos;s help. Maybe if they helped him, he would help them find the Chaos Emeralds.</string>

&#13;
A Voxai named Thebes told Sonic and friends that the Voxai leaders, the Overmind, were trying use Chaos Emeralds to mentally dominate the entire Voxai race! Thebes asked Sonic to help him rescue his people from the terrible power of the Overmind. If they do, they would receive the Chaos Emeralds as a reward!</string>

When the team agreed to help a Voxai named Thebes fight the Voxai Overmind&apos;s attempt to use Chaos Emeralds to dominate the entire Voxai race, Thebes&apos; friends turned against them and attacked! The team&apos;s path now was clear. They had to go against the Voxai Overmind, stop their tyrannical plans, and recover the Chaos Emeralds before it&apos;s too late!</string>

With the help of Thebes and the psychic powers within the stolen Chaos Emeralds, the team defeated the corrupt Voxai leaders, freeing the Voxai and making Thebes the new Overmind. What&apos;s more, the team recovered two more Chaos Emeralds in the process!&#13;

  <string id="19010">When the evil Lord Ix, leader of the mysterious Nocturnus Clan, stole the Master Emerald from Sonic&apos;s world, Sonic and his friends chased him into an alternate dimension to get the Emeralds back! In a series of challenges and adventures, they recovered all but two of the Chaos Emeralds, and the only place left to go is Ix&apos;s impenetrable fortress, the Nocturne!&#13;
&#13;
Thankfully, they were not alone in this pursuit. The alien races of the Twilight Cage all swore to aid Sonic and friends in their moment of need. And now, when the team faces down the greatest battle of their lives, is that moment!</string>

  <string id="19018">This is Voxai Colony Beta. To be honest, I never spent much time working with the Voxai. Lord Ix ordered us to keep our distance.</string>
  <string id="19019">Because he feared they might control your minds?</string>
  <string id="19020">Exactly.</string>
  <string id="19021">The Voxai Overmind keeps peace by controlling and tapping the minds of its people. Nocturnus patrols found themselves watched from all sides.</string>
  <string id="19022">Many of my brethren found themselves under the Overmind&apos;s control. We never saw them again.</string>
  <string id="19025">I think we can rely on the Chaos Emerald to protect us, but when we leave the ship, we might be vulnerable.</string>
  <string id="19026">Hey, last time the Zoah attacked us right when we left the ship. The way I see it, we&apos;re one step ahead already.</string>
  <string id="19027">We don&apos;t have a choice. To take on Ix, you need the Chaos Emeralds. And there were two here in this sector.</string>
  <string id="19028">My mind is strong. I am not worried.</string>
  <string id="19029">My friend, please.... I have seen powerful Nocturnus swayed by the Overmind&apos;s power. I don&apos;t wish to see you taken away.</string>
  <string id="19030">I will be fine. </string>
  <string id="19036">Why is that?</string>
  <string id="19056">Wow. This place is... </string>
  <string id="19103">Part 7</string>

  <string id="19124">At the hands of Eggman, no less! I can&apos;t believe he&apos;d turn on us like that!</string>
  <string id="19126">Yeah. Surprise, surprise.</string>

  <string id="19150">My biggest concern is how he could have built up such an army so quickly. We weren&apos;t gone very long!</string>
  <string id="19151">I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll get to the bottom of things... if we manage to survive that crash!</string>
  <string id="19152">What should we do in the meantime?</string>
  <string id="19153">That should kill some time! Great idea, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="19154">This game was developed by BioWare. Did you know BioWare was founded by a pair of doctors?</string>
  <string id="19155">It&apos;s true! Dr. Greg Zeschuk is the President, and Dr. Ray Muzyka is the CEO of the studio.</string>
  <string id="19156">No. They have a handheld group to do that for them. The handheld group is comprised of several departments.</string>
  <string id="19157">Well, there&apos;s the Production department. Mark Darrah was the Project Director. Dorian Kieken was Associate Producer, with Steve Lam as the Assistant Producer.</string>
  <string id="19158">Then there&apos;s the Design team, starting with Miles Holmes, the Lead Designer.  Graham Scott, Jonathan Epp and Jonathan Ferland were technical designers.</string>
  <string id="19159">I seriously doubt it. I&apos;m a super-genius, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="19160">Next up is Programming. Brook Bakay ran that crew with an iron fist. </string>
  <string id="19161">No way. Andy Desplenter and Scott Meadows were his tools programmers. Neil Flynn and Rejean Poirier also helped out with tools code.</string>
  <string id="19162">Yeah, thanks to the Art Department. Joel MacMillan was the Lead Artist, while Joy Ang, Nick Thornburrow and Brian Sum did concept, character, and level art.</string>
  <string id="19163">Yeah! And they had Elliot Christian, Dustin Nelson, and Francis Lacuna handling 3D modeling!</string>
  <string id="19164">Not by a long shot. They still had to animate the 3D stuff. Nick DiLiberto was in charge of that, and  he had help from Arneil Marquez. </string>
  <string id="19165">No, Sonic. That&apos;s something else.</string>
  <string id="19166">Steve Sim, I hear.  Get it?  I HEAR??? for the AUDIO guy? heh... Richard Jacques also wrote some of the music.</string>
  <string id="19167">Mitchell Fujino was the guy in charge of Quality Assurance. Working with him were Arone Le Bray, John Epler, and Michael Liaw.</string>
  <string id="19168">Not quite. They had to &quot;localize&quot; the game so that people speaking different languages could play it, too. </string>
  <string id="19169">Si, senor.</string>
  <string id="19170">Jenny McKearney was the Localization Producer. Her team included Chris Christou as the Lead Localization Tools Programmer, and Chris Mihalick as the Localization Tools Programmer. </string>
  <string id="19171">Still not done. Someone had to work with the folks outside of BioWare who made content for the game. That was John Campbell, External Producer.</string>
  <string id="19172">Definitely. There were a bunch of people who helped on the project in one way or another. If I were the Handheld team, I&apos;d probably want to thank them.</string>
  <string id="19173">Dan Tudge, for starters. He got the handheld group started before moving onto another project called Dragon Age.</string>
  <string id="19174">Then we might as well thank Vance Dylan, Jeremie Voillot, and Marwen Audeh while we&apos;re at it. I&apos;ll  also get E-123 Omega to rattle off the external credits. </string>
  <string id="19175">ARE ADAMANTIUM DOUBLE-LUBRICATED ACTUATOR JOINTS CAPABLE OF BOOSTING MY GROUNDSPEED BY APPROXIMATELY 15%?</string>
  <string id="19176">THE ANSWER IS YES TO BOTH QUESTIONS. LET ME BEGIN. I TRUST YOU WILL FIND THIS HIGHLY ENTERTAINING.</string>
  <string id="19177">NO. YOU DO NOT.</string>
  <string id="19178">SEGA OF AMERICA CREDITS ARE AS FOLLOWS:</string>
  <string id="19180">AND THAT&apos;S ALL OF IT.</string>
  <string id="19181">I SAID THAT&apos;S IT.</string>
  <string id="19182">.......</string>
  <string id="19183">STUPID MEATBAGS.</string>
  <string id="19184">I AM OUT OF HERE.</string>
  <string id="19185">It&apos;s over, Sonic. Omega&apos;s all done.</string>
  <string id="19186">Yep. At least until the next game!</string>
  <string id="19187">You&apos;re on!</string>
  <string id="19188">Seriously! It looks like we&apos;re done for!</string>
  <string id="19189">I didn&apos;t recognize the world when we got back. It looked as if we&apos;d been gone for years!</string>
  <string id="19190">Good point. I guess we&apos;ll have to wait for the next episode.</string>
  <string id="19191">We could talk about the team that came up with this caper in the first place.</string>
  <string id="19192">Yeah, I know.</string>
  <string id="19193">Doctors AND game developers? No way!</string>
  <string id="19194">Did these guys make the game themselves? It would take a pair of real mathletes like YOU to do that.</string>
  <string id="19195">Such as?</string>
  <string id="19196">Okay. Who else?</string>
  <string id="19197">Hey, another Miles! I wonder if you two also share the same IQ?</string>
  <string id="19198">Right. </string>
  <string id="19199">That&apos;s all the programmers? </string>
  <string id="19200">I noticed we look really sweet in this game. Our world and the Twilight Cage were also pretty spiffy.</string>
  <string id="19201">Cool!</string>
  <string id="19202">Is that all?</string>
  <string id="19203">Gooey art? Is that like a sticky bomb?</string>
  <string id="19204">What about audio? Who did that?</string>
  <string id="19205">Riiiight.  So, these games take a lot of testing to make sure they run smoothly. Who handled that?</string>
  <string id="19206">Is that about it?</string>
  <string id="19207">Seriously? So somewhere out there, some kid might be playing this in... uh... Spanish?</string>
  <string id="19208">Very funny. Well, okay, who did that?</string>
  <string id="19209">That&apos;s gotta just about cover it.</string>
  <string id="19210">So people worked on the game who weren&apos;t part of the Handheld team?</string>
  <string id="19211">Like who?</string>
  <string id="19212">Well, that&apos;s it, then. But I see we&apos;re still here. Our next adventure isn&apos;t quite ready to go!</string>
  <string id="19213">This ought to be good. Omega, do you know the rest of the people who worked on this game?</string>
  <string id="19214">Uh....</string>
  <string id="19215">Do we have a choice?</string>
  <string id="19216">.......</string>
  <string id="19219">Zzzzzzzzzzzzz....</string>

His first plan involved imprisoning animals inside robots to serve his every whim, but when Sonic thwarted that evil plan, he moved on to bigger, deadlier pursuits. An engineering genius with an IQ of 300, Eggman is a master at building disastrously destructive machines, nigh-impenetrable fortresses, and diabolical robots that could have conquered the world many times over. &#13;

The Nocturnus Clan mysteriously disappeared 4000 years ago, just after Pachacamac tapped the Chaos Emeralds and the Knuckles Clan was destroyed by Perfect Chaos. Until recently, only legends survived of the powerful ancient echidna race that once nearly controlled  the world, but now it seems the Nocturnus Clan has returned!</string>
  <string id="19386">The Nocturnus Clan are a nation of echidnas who lived in Sonic&apos;s world in ancient times. Led by the powerful chief Ix and bolstered by their highly advanced technology, the Nocturnus Clan very nearly conquered the ancient world.

The Nocturnus historian, Nestor the Wise, revealed that the Nocturnus invented the Gizoids, including Emerl, leading to the suggestion that the Nocturnus Clan actually was the Fourth Great Civilization proposed by Prof. Gerald Robotnik.</string>

  <string id="19808">Weird writing. I wonder where it came from?</string>
  <string id="19809">Maybe someone used it as payment for a Night Stalker charm.</string>
  <string id="19810">Maybe if we go back to the Kron colony, Nestor can help us figure out what it says!</string>
  <string id="19811">I can&apos;t make out what it says. Maybe we can find someone who can!</string>
  <string id="19812">I was out of a job! The military said they had no use for a &quot;simple&quot; holo-emitter, so I decided to show them!</string>
  <string id="19813">And I figured I could make some money on the side selling these trinkets to gullible citizens. It was a perfect plan!</string>
  <string id="19814">I would have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn&apos;t for you meddling heroes!</string>

  <string id="19824">Heh. Don&apos;t we?</string>
  <string id="19829">I guess your Night Stalker is shut down for good.</string>
  <string id="19839">Why did you do it, Haniman?</string>

  <string id="20027">Big the Cat has a problem: One of Froggy&apos;s friends, a frog named Norton, has gone missing!&#13;
&#13;
Big asked Sonic to look for Norton. He&apos;s somewhere in Green Hill Zone, and Big isn&apos;t too sure what he looks like, but he&apos;s out there somewhere!</string>
  <string id="20030">While out looking for Norton the Frog, Sonic came upon Mrs. Stevens. How could Sonic ever mistake Mrs. Stevens for Norton?&#13;
&#13;
Sonic still needs to find poor Norton, who is still somewhere out in Green Hill Zone.</string>
  <string id="20031">Sonic thought he had found Norton, but it was just good ol&apos; Mr. Billywick, out for a night on the town. Silly Mr. Billywick!&#13;
&#13;
Sonic still needs to find poor Norton, who is still somewhere out in Green Hill Zone.</string>
  <string id="20032">Sonic found yet another frog, but this time it was Gally, whose mother would be very cross if she knew where her daughter was!&#13;
&#13;
Sonic still needs to find poor Norton, who is still somewhere out in Green Hill Zone.</string>
  <string id="20033">Sonic found Norton! Hooray!&#13;
&#13;
Froggy was very relieved that Norton was safe. At least, that&apos;s what Big told Sonic. Frogs are very good at hiding their emotions.</string>
  <string id="20034">Sonic took Cheese back to Cream! Cream was very happy to see her bonded Chao!&#13;
&#13;
Her friend safe and sound, Cream was excited to join the team and help Sonic!</string>
  <string id="20035">Search Green Hill Zone for any sign of Cream&apos;s friend, Cheese!&#13;
&#13;
Cream has been searching everywhere for Cheese, and she asked Sonic to help! She says that she lost track of Cheese somewhere in Green Hill Zone.</string>
  <string id="20036">Take Cheese back to Cream!&#13;
&#13;
Sonic and friends found Cheese hiding in Green Hill Zone. It&apos;s a sure bet Cream will be very happy to see her friend!</string>
  <string id="20037">Sonic took Cheese back to Cream! Cream was very happy to see her bonded Chao!</string>
  <string id="20038">Cream and Cheese</string>
  <string id="20042">After a bit of a &quot;discussion&quot; with Sonic and his friends, Shadow the Hedgehog confessed that he was looking for his friend, E-123 Omega, who he believed was in trouble somewhere in Metropolis. &#13;
&#13;
Tails and Eggman&apos;s team found Omega, deactivated and guarded by Marauder robots. They reactivated him, and he has agreed to join the fight to get his revenge against the Marauders.</string>
  <string id="20046">The Search for Omega</string>
  <string id="20047">Rouge asked Sonic for a favor: GUN asked her to return from the Twilight Cage with samples of Nocturnus Clan technology, and she wanted Sonic&apos;s help to get it!&#13;
&#13;
Sonic brought Rouge a bunch of Nocturnus Tech, and in true Rouge fashion, she got bored and asked him to stop. She gave Sonic the reward GUN promised if he helped her, and she asked him not to bring her any more Nocturnus Tech.</string>

  <string id="20222">Sonic met a man who was stuck inside a small booth. The man asked Sonic to bring him a newspaper. &#13;

That shouldn&apos;t be too hard. Maybe someone sells newspapers in Station Square!</string>

  <string id="20240">We can&apos;t let the Nocturne enter our world! We have to stop him!</string>
  <string id="20241">The team has recovered one of the Chaos Emeralds, but they have a long way to go to recover all seven and the Master Emerald. Tails&apos; sensors have detected Chaos Emeralds from Sectors Scylla and Charyb, as well as Ix&apos;s fortress, Nocturne. Unfortunately, a repulsor field surrounds Nocturne, so it&apos;s impossible to land anywhere near it.&#13;
&#13;
Sector Scylla is home to the slime-race known as the N&apos;rrgal and a race of militaristic giants known as the Zoah. The N&apos;rrgal Queen herself gave the team a choice. If they steal the Zoah&apos;s secret weapon, then the N&apos;rrgal will allow the team to escape... and give them the &quot;Gem of Power&quot; that Ix gave her as a gift!&#13;
&#13;
The team made it past the guards at the gate and inside the base. Now they must find the Zoah&apos;s secret weapon!</string>
  <string id="20249">What the--</string>
  <string id="20250">Ha ha ha ha! Insignificant fools! Come! Face me now!</string>
  <string id="20251">Sonic... he&apos;s too powerful. We can&apos;t beat him like this!</string>
  <string id="20252">I have an idea. If he can use the power of the Emeralds, then so can I!</string>
  <string id="20253">I summon the ultimate power of the Nocturnus! The power of the Nocturne itself!</string>
  <string id="20260">We can&apos;t beat him like this! We have to get the Master Emerald!</string>
  <string id="20261">You stay here and keep Ix busy. I&apos;ll go get the Master Emerald!</string>
  <string id="20262">Ha ha ha! Yes, insects! Scramble to survive!</string>
  <string id="20263">Sonic, it&apos;s up to you. Stall him!</string>
  <string id="20264">I think it&apos;s the only chance we have, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="20266">Right. Good luck, Knuckles.</string>
  <string id="20269">Are you sure that&apos;s the best idea?</string>
  <string id="20273">That should do it!</string>
  <string id="20275">Finally. A worthy opponent.</string>
  <string id="20276">Let&apos;s see what you can do!</string>
  <string id="20308">What you wannnt is nnnot immmportant. We have before us the deadliessst enemmmies of the Nocturnusss Clannn. Surely, we would be rewarded....</string>
  <string id="20331">We should be going.</string>
  <string id="20450">(Pirates... yes! I have heard tales of pirates in the spaces between the colonies, attacking supply ships and taking their cargo.)</string>
  <string id="20451">(I seem to remember that the Kron were the last ones hit. A shipment of ore meant for the Zoah, if I recall.)</string>
  <string id="20452">(Maybe you should talk to a trader on the Kron colony.)</string>
  <string id="20453">(Very well. Good day.)</string>
  <string id="20508">Angel Island is the home of the Master Emerald, the most powerful relic in Sonic&apos;s world, and the Emerald&apos;s guardian, Knuckles. The island itself once floated in midair over the land, held aloft by the power of the Master Emerald. &#13;
&#13;
Around four thousand years ago, Angel Island was part of the city now known as Mystic Ruins. On Angel Island stood a shrine to the Master Emerald and the Chaos Emeralds. Pachacamac, the chief of Knuckles&apos; clan, tried to steal the Chaos Emeralds and angered its guardian spirit, who became Perfect Chaos. This god-like being virtually destroyed Knuckles&apos; clan in revenge. &#13;
&#13;
The actions of Perfect Chaos resulted in an energy backlash that ripped Angel Island from the ground, causing it to float above what is now Mystic Ruins. Before Perfect Chaos could do any more damage, Pachacamac&apos;s daughter, Tikal, managed to seal it and herself inside the Master Emerald. Over the centuries, the few surviving members of Knuckles&apos; clan became even fewer. Knuckles is, at present, the last of his kind.&#13;
&#13;
When Sonic and his friends rescued Knuckles, they looked into the sky over Mystic Ruins and found that Angel Island was missing!</string>

  <string id="20663">You said stop it. You didn&apos;t tell me to keep it in one piece!</string>

  <string id="20684">I can&apos;t do that. Shade sent me here to stop you.</string>
  <string id="20687">You expect me to tell you that? Now, now, Sonic. We just met.</string>
  <string id="20688">All you need to know is that Shade sent me here to stop you.</string>

  <string id="20695">Then let&apos;s see you try!</string>
  <string id="20698">Who is Shade?</string>

  <string id="20702">Knuckles is missing! He was kidnapped by the Marauders, a gang of criminals who have been stealing the Chaos Emeralds!&#13;

Sonic was attacked by a Marauder on the bridge to Central City. While Sonic defeated the Marauder, it&apos;s a good bet the Marauders know Sonic&apos;s back!&#13;

Amy Rose and Sonic must get to Tails&apos; Workshop in Central City, just south of Green Hill Zone.</string>
  <string id="20704">We&apos;ve seen the Marauders with Eggman&apos;s robots. It&apos;s obvious that they&apos;re in cahoots!</string>
  <string id="20723">Yes, yes. Of course. That&apos;s what I came up with, as well.</string>
  <string id="20724">Simple! They don&apos;t have the numbers to take on the GUN soldiers stationed in Mystic Ruins.... </string>
  <string id="20725">So they decided to bring the island to Metropolis! </string>
  <string id="20726">Yes, it&apos;s brilliant, isn&apos;t it? It&apos;s precisely what I would have done.</string>
  <string id="20727">Ahem.</string>
  <string id="20728">The Marauders must be using Eggman&apos;s old robots to fool us into going after Eggman instead!</string>
  <string id="20729">We have to stop them.</string>
  <string id="20730">Why would they do that?</string>
  <string id="20733">Then we should go to Metropolis, right?</string>
  <string id="20739">Sonic and the team found five Eggman devices, and Tails combined them into one machine! According to Tails, the machine is some kind of pattern generator. He thinks he could use it to get past the forcefield the team found in Green Hill Zone!</string>

  <string id="21142">Yes, but I&apos;m not sure how. Let&apos;s keep looking for Eggman, and I&apos;ll think of something.</string>
  <string id="21143">Could we use that pattern device to get past it?</string>
  <string id="21144">Any idea yet how to get past it?</string>
  <string id="21156">We have to get through it.</string>
  <string id="21168">Right. Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="21175">Right. I&apos;ve searched my files for mention of Shade, but I haven&apos;t found anything.</string>
  <string id="21176">Maybe GUN will know more about this Shade person.</string>

  <string id="21183">We&apos;ll contact Rouge if we learn anything while you&apos;re in the field.</string>
  <string id="21184">Do you know anything about someone named Shade?</string>
  <string id="21189">Do you know anything about a Marauder named Shade?</string>
  <string id="21191">Their leader is named Shade. She&apos;s... tough. She nearly took me down on her own.</string>
  <string id="21192">There&apos;s something else, though. The Marauders wanted to get rid of me, but Shade ordered them to just lock me up.</string>
  <string id="21193">For whatever reason, I think she wanted to keep me alive.</string>
  <string id="21196">Everything else he&apos;s tried has failed. I wouldn&apos;t put it past him to hide behind a group like the Marauders.</string>
  <string id="21197">Could the Marauders be working for Eggman?</string>

  <string id="21202">Almost there, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="21203">We have to hold him off! Tails needs more time!</string>
  <string id="21204">We can do it!</string>
  <string id="21205">Then let&apos;s go!</string>

  <string id="21487">Nice job! You figured out the code!</string>
  <string id="21488">Having trouble? I can help!</string>
  <string id="21489">Hey, it&apos;s Sonic! I&apos;m glad you came along. Maybe you can help me solve this puzzle!</string>
  <string id="21490">This door is secured with a code lock. You have to enter the right sequence to open it.</string>
  <string id="21491">Ha! Just as I remembered! The code is... well... hm. It has been a long time since I used this door!</string>
  <string id="21492">I&apos;ve been working on this a while now. I can help you get it open for a price!</string>
  <string id="21493">All right. Just touch the Exit Arrow to close the puzzle, and come see me if you need some help.</string>
  <string id="21494">Good luck!</string>
  <string id="21495">All right.</string>
  <string id="21496">That&apos;s all I can tell you. If I know more, I&apos;d have gotten in there already!</string>

  <string id="21513">Let me try it on my own.</string>
  <string id="21514">Done well you. Impressed am I.</string>
  <string id="21515">Need you my help?</string>
  <string id="21516">Cross you these conveyors to reach factory. But in the way the deadly rock crushers are.</string>
  <string id="21517">Never crossed conveyors have the Kron. Have I some idea how to cross, if need you some hints.</string>
  <string id="21518">Go you now. Cross you conveyors and reach the factory. Fast someone try to run across when combo right you have.</string>
  <string id="21519">Solid ground.</string>
  <string id="21520">Told you all I know have I. Yours this is to solve alone.</string>
  <string id="21521">All right.</string>
  <string id="21522">Connected are the switches, one to each crusher.  Settings on each switch there are.</string>
  <string id="21523">If set are the crushers in the correct order, then run through could one who moves with great speed.</string>

  <string id="21535">You got the vents working. Well done!</string>
  <string id="21536">Stumped? I&apos;m authorized to help you for a price.</string>
  <string id="21537">Ah, Sonic the Hedgehog. I wondered if there was anyone else but me in this place.</string>
  <string id="21538">I&apos;ve seen some suspicious activity on those high cliffs. Maybe if you got those vents blowing, you could fly up there.</string>
  <string id="21539">Good luck getting the vents working, though.</string>
  <string id="21540">I think I have some ideas about how it works. If you need my help, I&apos;ll give you hints for a price.</string>
  <string id="21541">All right. Touch the Exit Arrow to close the puzzle, and come see me if you need some help.</string>
  <string id="21542">Good luck.</string>
  <string id="21543">All right.</string>
  <string id="21544">I can&apos;t help you at this point. You&apos;re on your own.</string>
  <string id="21545">The hatch to the left stores power cells, and the other hatch seems to have a plug socket for them.</string>
  <string id="21546">Stepping on the right pressure plates might open the round hatches over there.</string>

  <string id="21561">You got it workin&apos;. I&apos;ll be darned.</string>
  <string id="21562">Giving up on the escalator?</string>
  <string id="21563">I&apos;ve been scavenging here in Metropolis since the Egg Carrier crashed, and I have yet to get up on top of that building.</string>
  <string id="21564">Looks like there&apos;s an escalator that goes up there, but you have to hit those switches in a certain way to activate the escalator.</string>
  <string id="21565">Beats me how you do it. Feel free to try for yourself. Maybe I can help you for a price.</string>
  <string id="21566">It&apos;s your time you&apos;re wastin&apos;. Touch the Exit Arrow to close the puzzle, and come talk to me if you want my help.</string>
  <string id="21567">Good luck.</string>
  <string id="21568">You know everything I know about this thing. I never said it&apos;d be easy.</string>

  <string id="21590">(Good luck!)</string>
  <string id="21591">(I&apos;m afraid that&apos;s all I know. Sorry!)</string>
  <string id="21592">(Of course.)</string>
  <string id="21593">(When the display shows a color, sometimes it flashes twice.  That&apos;s a negative signal.  Don&apos;t hit the switch when it does that.)</string>
  <string id="21594">(Reaction time is important in how you activate those switches.  Hit the right switch as fast as you can after the matching color flashes.)</string>

  <string id="21610">Hey! Keep it down! Do you need some help?</string>
  <string id="21611">Hey! Good work with those guards. If you want to get through those doors, though, you&apos;ll have to figure out the passcode!</string>
  <string id="21612">The best I can figure, this machine computes a formula to allow the user to figure out the code to the door.</string>
  <string id="21613">I bet YOU can solve this puzzle. Maybe I can help... for a price.</string>
  <string id="21614">Sure. Maybe you&apos;ll see something I didn&apos;t.</string>
  <string id="21615">I&apos;ll keep a lookout. Go!</string>
  <string id="21616">You&apos;re gotten as far as I have. I can&apos;t help you from here.</string>
  <string id="21617">All right.</string>
  <string id="21618">The code you&apos;re trying to crack uses the same mathematical pattern as the sample code.</string>
  <string id="21619">The numbers on the screens form a sample code. Stand on the plate to try cracking a code, and use the switch to choose the fourth number.</string>
  <string id="21620">I&apos;m not the biggest fan of the Military. If you can go in and shake things up, then I want to help!</string>
  <string id="21621">Psst! You need a keycard to work this machine. Maybe you can get one from the guards by the door to the west!</string>
  <string id="21623">I&apos;ll try it on my own.</string>

  <string id="21949">Where did the Nocturnus Clan get a gizoid?</string>
  <string id="22070">But they clearly know you&apos;re here, Sonic, and they&apos;re trying to stop you!</string>
  <string id="22071">After what they did to Knuckles... I don&apos;t want you to get hurt!</string>
  <string id="22072">Don&apos;t worry about me, Amy. I&apos;ll be just fine.</string>
  <string id="22073">Fine. See if I ever worry about you again!</string>
  <string id="22074">Let&apos;s just go find Tails. Is his workshop still to the east of here?</string>
  <string id="22075">Yep! Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="22083">This looks like the place, team.</string>
  <string id="22084">This certainly looks like somewhere Eggman would hang out.</string>
  <string id="22085">This is our chance to find out what&apos;s really going on.</string>
  <string id="22086">Ew. It smells like oil and... moustache. This HAS to be the place.</string>
  <string id="22087">I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m ready to fight Eggman... but I&apos;ll try!</string>
  <string id="22088">Lookit! Robots!</string>
  <string id="22089">We&apos;ve got company, team. Get ready!</string>
  <string id="22093">Exploring Mystic Ruins, the team found the secret hidden Marauder base!&#13;
&#13;
Now they must explore the base, and with luck, find Knuckles alive!</string>
  <string id="22094">Well, team, according to my calculations, this is the place.</string>
  <string id="22095">I hope Knuckles is okay!</string>
  <string id="22096">I don&apos;t like it here. Can we go?</string>
  <string id="22097">We&apos;re okay, Big. Sonic&apos;s here!</string>
  <string id="22098">For crying out loud. Did someone forget his blankie?</string>
  <string id="22099">Pft. Knuckles is fine, Pinky. He&apos;s a fighter.</string>
  <string id="22100">Don&apos;t call me Pinky!</string>
  <string id="22101">Hm. If this is a Marauder hideout, maybe we should take a look around.</string>
  <string id="22102">Let&apos;s get moving, team. Knuckles won&apos;t rescue himself.</string>
  <string id="22191">Hm. Not quite. You&apos;re still being too impatient. </string>
  <string id="22193">Brr... I&apos;m cold!</string>
  <string id="22194">Think warm thoughts, kiddo. You&apos;ll be fine.</string>
  <string id="22195">Blue Ridge Zone. Y&apos;know, once you&apos;ve terrorized an area once or twice, it&apos;s just never the same again.</string>
  <string id="22196">....</string>
  <string id="22197">....</string>
  <string id="22198">What?</string>
  <string id="22199">Hmph. If I&apos;d known it&apos;d be this cold, I&apos;d have worn my other boots.</string>
  <string id="22200">We don&apos;t know much about this place. We need to be careful.</string>
  <string id="22201">I&apos;ve never really been here before. It seems... quiet.</string>
  <string id="22202">Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="22213">Then let&apos;s stop messing around and get Angel Island back.</string>
  <string id="22214">We&apos;re just wasting time.</string>
  <string id="22215">Right. He needs to tinker with his machines. Meanwhile, the Marauders are about to get their hands on the Master Emerald.</string>
  <string id="22216">You know I can&apos;t let that happen, Sonic. I swore to protect the Emeralds with my life.</string>
  <string id="22217">The Marauders took the first couple without anyone knowing. They had some kind of teleportation device, or something.</string>
  <string id="22218">One minute, there was no one there. The next, there they were, stealing the Emerald. Then, gone again. Like ghosts.</string>
  <string id="22219">When they took the last Chaos Emerald, I tried to fight them.</string>
  <string id="22220">I asked Tails to build a trap, but I knew that we couldn&apos;t catch them if they didn&apos;t want us to.</string>
  <string id="22221">I&apos;m not sure. I think maybe they just wanted to test me, see what I could do.</string>
  <string id="22222">Shade knew they had the upper hand. Maybe she just wanted to make sure I knew that.</string>
  <string id="22223">I agree.</string>
  <string id="22227">Tell me more about what happened to the Chaos Emeralds.</string>
  <string id="22231">I want to get the Emeralds back as much as you do.</string>
  <string id="22233">They can teleport. Why would they stick around to fight you?</string>
  <string id="22235">We have to stop them.</string>
  <string id="22236">no bond</string>
  <string id="22243">Sonic, this Marauder is one of the strongest foes we&apos;ve met yet! Are you sure we&apos;re ready to fight him?</string>
  <string id="22244">Maybe you should explore Green Hill Zone and make sure we&apos;ve got everything you need to beat him!</string>
  <string id="22245">Good. Shade told me just to stop you, but I&apos;d much rather knock you out.</string>
  <string id="22246">Good luck, team!</string>
  <string id="22247">Please. Feel free to play in this little sandbox all you like. Nothing here will help you get past this bridge.</string>
  <string id="22248">But by all means, come back if you think you&apos;re ready to try.</string>
  <string id="22249">The Marauders are powerful, Sonic. Much more powerful than a few armadillos and boars!</string>
  <string id="22250">If this Shade sent just one to stop you, she must be confident that he has a chance against you!</string>
  <string id="22252">I&apos;m ready to fight this Marauder now.</string>
  <string id="22255">You may be right. Let&apos;s come back later.</string>
  <string id="22258">It&apos;s just one Marauder. How tough could it be?</string>
  <string id="22261">You again. Have you come back to try and get past me?</string>
  <string id="22262">Sonic, are you sure you&apos;re ready to fight him?</string>
  <string id="22264">I&apos;m ready to fight!</string>
  <string id="22265">Not yet. We&apos;ll be back.</string>
  <string id="22274">Careful you. Need permission you to access the conveyor.</string>

  <string id="22324">This is your inventory! The inventory holds your rings, consumables, equippable items, quest items, and even Chao. Here you can equip, use, or swap out these things as you wish.&#13;
&#13;
Use the Exit Arrow on the lower left of the Touch Screen to return to the game.</string>
  <string id="22325">This is your Chao Garden!  Move around the Touch Screen to see your collection of Chao, creatures that bond with Sonic and his friends to give them abilities.&#13;
&#13;
Chao are social creatures; you can trade them with two different friends to help them to grow in power and reach their full potential (Max!).&#13;
Collect the whole set!</string>
  <string id="22326">You just found a Chao egg, and it will hatch soon! Look for the Chao Garden in the Corner Menu to learn more, and collect eggs whenever you can.  You never know what Chao you will get!</string>
  <string id="22327">You leveled up!  &#13;
&#13;
When your characters level up, their stats improve automatically, but you also get a bonus point to add to the stat of your choice (to a maximum of 10 points). &#13;
&#13;
Eventually, your movement abilities will improve, too.</string>

  <string id="22336">Oh no!</string>
  <string id="22337">Is Sonic okay?!</string>
  <string id="22338">Is he ever NOT okay?</string>
  <string id="22339">I knew it.</string>
  <string id="22340">You know what they say about &quot;loose lips.&quot;</string>
  <string id="22341">Hooray!</string>
  <string id="22342">Yay!</string>
  <string id="22343">Now we&apos;re talking.</string>
  <string id="22344">Yeah! Let&apos;s get &apos;em!</string>
  <string id="22345">Hooray!</string>
  <string id="22346">I don&apos;t know, the Marauders have done an awful lot of withstanding so far.</string>
  <string id="22347">I&apos;m not sure that&apos;s exactly what we&apos;re looking for.</string>
  <string id="22348">Why am I not surprised?</string>
  <string id="22349">Oh please. Do you even have any wrath left?</string>
  <string id="22350">Of course I-- er, no. Not really.</string>
  <string id="22351">Good. Maybe we can see some action.</string>
  <string id="22352">Uh oh! Hee hee hee!</string>
  <string id="22353">Ooh! Am I invited, too?</string>
  <string id="22354">Yay! We found it!</string>
  <string id="22355">Do you even know what that means?</string>
  <string id="22356">Nope!</string>
  <string id="22357">Oh, good. If we run into anything that needs defragulating, we&apos;re all set.</string>
  <string id="22358">Ionic de-what-ulator?</string>
  <string id="22359">Hee hee hee, that&apos;s a funny name!</string>
  <string id="22360">This is stupid. We&apos;re wasting time. We should be out there fighting.</string>
  <string id="22361">Sonic wants us safe down here. We&apos;re wave two, Shadow. We&apos;re supposed to come in once they&apos;ve cleared the way!</string>
  <string id="22388">All right!</string>
  <string id="22389">Yay!</string>
  <string id="22390">Hooray!</string>
  <string id="22391">Just what I&apos;ve always wanted.</string>
  <string id="22392">Don&apos;t celebrate yet. The captain hit an alarm. The whole fleet knows we took this ship.</string>
  <string id="22393">Let&apos;s stop jawing and do it.</string>
  <string id="22394">No need to be rude!</string>
  <string id="22395">There&apos;s no time to be polite.</string>
  <string id="22396">Right!</string>
  <string id="22397">Yay! Can I fly the boat? Please!?</string>
  <string id="22398">Ugh. I think I&apos;m getting seasick.</string>
  <string id="22399">Good idea. Let&apos;s try it.</string>
  <string id="22400">Not what I&apos;d call a romantic cruise.</string>
  <string id="22401">We get to fly?</string>
  <string id="22402">I like boats!</string>
  <string id="22403">That sounds really dangerous. Is there another way?</string>
  <string id="22404">Does it matter? Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="22405">Looks like you forgot to clean up when you were done.</string>
  <string id="22406">I remember. Let&apos;s not stay down here long.</string>
  <string id="22441">Ah, Sonic. Isn&apos;t it lovely, you and I, working together?</string>
  <string id="22443">Hey Sonic. I&apos;m worried about Knuckles. You should go talk to him.</string>
  <string id="22444">Good. Come talk to me once you&apos;re done, and we&apos;ll go!</string>
  <string id="22445">Knuckles just found out some serious news, Sonic. He&apos;s not the last of his kind after all!</string>
  <string id="22446">It might be hard for him to handle. Maybe he needs someone to talk to!</string>
  <string id="22447">We need Knuckles ready to fight, Sonic. And with everything you two have been through, you&apos;re the only one he trusts.</string>
  <string id="22448">Please, Sonic. Just go try!</string>
  <string id="22450">Okay, I&apos;ll do that.</string>
  <string id="22452">Why bother? He&apos;s just sulking.</string>
  <string id="22454">Do I have to?</string>
  <string id="22456">Movies</string>
  <string id="22457">No Movies Active Yet</string>
  <string id="22458">Information about movie entries will appear here once they are active.</string>
  <string id="22459">When you&apos;re ready to go, just go outside and interact with the plane. We&apos;ll be in Mystic Ruins in no time!</string>
  <string id="22463">I wouldn&apos;t have thought it would happen in a million years. A trillion! Ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="22464">Well, still, here we are. My genius and your blind running about, teamed up for the good of the world.</string>
  <string id="22465">It makes me feel strange, saving the world. Not entirely uncomfortable, either.</string>
  <string id="22466">Once more into the breach! Take that, evil! Ha!</string>
  <string id="22468">That gentleman over there looks shifty. Maybe he knows something about this code.</string>
  <string id="22469">Right! Let&apos;s go talk to him!</string>
  <string id="22470">Ha! You expect a mind such as mine to busy itself remembering every little code it comes up with?</string>
  <string id="22471">Please, my blue friend. Don&apos;t insult me!</string>
  <string id="22473">Me neither.</string>
  <string id="22475">We have work to do.</string>
  <string id="22477">It&apos;s worked out well enough so far.</string>
  <string id="22478">If it&apos;s up to me, it&apos;ll never happen again.</string>
  <string id="22479">Gotcha. Let&apos;s crack that code!</string>
  <string id="22482">It&apos;s your hideout, Eggman. Don&apos;t you remember the code?</string>
  <string id="22485">We have to get moving, Sonic. What&apos;s the hold up?</string>
  <string id="22486">Be ready. We&apos;re leaving very soon.</string>
  <string id="22487">I suppose you CAN give an old robot a new program, after all.</string>
  <string id="22488">I have work to do, my blue friend. Good luck to you.</string>
  <string id="22489">Sh! Not so loud! I have an evil reputation to uphold!</string>
  <string id="22490">We will destroy those Marauders! Ha ha ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="22491">Er, and by &quot;destroy&quot; I mean &quot;bring to justice.&quot; Yes. Ahem.</string>
  <string id="22492">Oh, yes. We&apos;ve had much adventure, and not nearly as much puppy hugging and flower-sniffing as I expected.</string>
  <string id="22493">Yes, well. It seems as if your friend Tails might have other ideas. Smart kid, that. He understands my brilliance.</string>
  <string id="22494">You get used to it.</string>
  <string id="22497">This could be your chance to really do some good.</string>
  <string id="22503">The Dimensional Buffer is a fine invention. Pity I never had a chance to try it out.</string>
  <string id="22504">At least, not since that one time. I never did see those pants again.</string>
  <string id="22505">It feels nice to be working in my old lab again! Oh, the great machines I&apos;ve created in here!</string>
  <string id="22506">Once we have power, I&apos;ll get that rocket built in no time! Ha ha ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="22511">What now?</string>
  <string id="22512">Sorry, Sonic. Eggman and I are busy working on this rocket.</string>
  <string id="22513">You got the generators working! Now all we need is that Dimensional Buffer!</string>
  <string id="22514">We still need the generators working before we can work on the rocket. Hurry!</string>
  <string id="22518">Sorry, Sonic. Eggman and I are busy working on this rocket.</string>

  <string id="22582">Now, let&apos;s see. I seem to remember a code of some sort. We&apos;ll have to crack it to get inside.</string>
  <string id="22585">I can understand that.</string>
  <string id="22586">Still, maybe just go see how he&apos;s doing?</string>

  <string id="22728">I&apos;m sure the eggheads over at GUN will have a field day with this... whatever it is.</string>
  <string id="22729">Got any more?</string>
  <string id="22731">I have some Nocturnus Tech for you.</string>
  <string id="22734">Yep! Here you go.</string>
  <string id="22735">Not right now.</string>
  <string id="22736">Rouge has asked Sonic for a favor: GUN asked her to return from the Twilight Cage with samples of Nocturnus Clan technology, and she&apos;d like Sonic&apos;s help to get it!&#13;
&#13;
Sonic has brought some Nocturnus Tech to Rouge, but she needs more. He should bring the Nocturnus Tech to her in the Cyclone whenever he gets some from fallen Nocturnus enemies!</string>
  <string id="22740">Oooh. Another piece of Nocturnus tech. Help me control my excitement.</string>
  <string id="22741">You know what? If I see another piece of Nocturnus garbage, I might just scream.</string>
  <string id="22742">If you promise me you won&apos;t bring me any more, I&apos;ll give you this pack of goodies I &quot;found.&quot;</string>
  <string id="22743">Promise?</string>
  <string id="22744">Oh, good grief, no. Who cares? It&apos;s not shiny or even worth all that much. It&apos;s just toys for the geeks at GUN.</string>
  <string id="22745">Who cares? For all they know, that&apos;s all the Nocturnus tech in the whole galaxy or whatever.</string>
  <string id="22746">C&apos;mon, Big Blue. Promise you won&apos;t pile any more stupid Nocturnus junk on me.</string>
  <string id="22747">Good. Finally. I can go do important things like sitting around looking pretty.</string>
  <string id="22748">Talk to you later, handsome.</string>
  <string id="22749">Ho hum. You&apos;d think they&apos;d have a better assignment than this for a girl like me.</string>
  <string id="22750">I&apos;m not sure why they want this stuff. It looks like junk to me. </string>
  <string id="22751">GUN will get a real kick out of this, I&apos;m sure... if they can figure out what it does.</string>
  <string id="22752">All right. Just come see ol&apos; Rouge when you&apos;ve got more Nocturnus Tech. I&apos;ll make it worth your while!</string>
  <string id="22756">Promise. Thanks!</string>
  <string id="22757">You don&apos;t want any more tech?</string>
  <string id="22758">What will GUN say when they hear you quit your mission?</string>
  <string id="22760">Okay, I promise.</string>
  <string id="22767">Rouge has asked Sonic for a favor: GUN asked her to return from the Twilight Cage with samples of Nocturnus Clan technology, and she&apos;d like Sonic&apos;s help to get it!&#13;
&#13;
Nocturnus Clan foes may leave their Nocturnus Tech behind when they are defeated. Sonic should bring this technology to Rouge in the Cyclone!</string>
  <string id="22769">I&apos;m relieved that Knuckles is safe. I was so worried!</string>
  <string id="22770">Now that he&apos;s back, though, we can concentrate on finding Eggman!</string>

  <string id="22783">I think so. I don&apos;t trust him very much, but I have to admit, he&apos;s a brilliant scientist!</string>
  <string id="22784">We better get to work. Just head out and activate the Tornado when you&apos;re ready to go!</string>

  <string id="22796">We won&apos;t win this one by being overconfident. We have to be better.</string>
  <string id="22797">That&apos;s right. Let&apos;s get to work.</string>
  <string id="22798">Then let&apos;s hear your plan, Knuckles. This ought to be good.</string>
  <string id="22799">Oh, this is nothing. We&apos;ve faced worse than the Marauders.</string>
  <string id="22801">Of course you are. You don&apos;t know what you&apos;re missing!</string>
  <string id="22802">No, thanks. We&apos;re fine.</string>

  <string id="22834">Hang on a sec, Sonic. There&apos;s something we should discuss!</string>
  <string id="22835">As we continue on this adventure, it&apos;s a good idea for you to save your game from time to time... like when you met the Marauder at the bridge!</string>
  <string id="22836">That way, if we lose a fight, or if you decide to take a break, we can start over at our last save.</string>
  <string id="22837">You can save the game by pressing START or touching the bottom-left corner of the Touch Screen, then choosing the top-left icon in the Corner Menu!</string>
  <string id="22838">Then choose which slot you want to use, and save the game!</string>
  <string id="22839">It&apos;s up to you to remember to save your game as you go, Sonic, so keep that in mind!</string>
  <string id="22840">Whew. Now that&apos;s out of the way. Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="22844">How do I save my game again?</string>
  <string id="22848">I know all about that. Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="22850">By the way, Sonic, since we just defeated a tough opponent, this might be a good time to save your game like we talked about. </string>
  <string id="22851">Sure, Sonic. Just trying to be helpful!</string>
  <string id="22852">Gotcha. Thanks.</string>
  <string id="22854">How do I do that, again?</string>
  <string id="22855">Stop reminding me. I&apos;ll save when I&apos;m ready.</string>
  <string id="22857">This might even be a good time to save your game, Sonic! That way if we lose this fight, we can pick back up where we left off!</string>
  <string id="22858">First you need to back away from this fight. Just for a moment!</string>
  <string id="22859">After that, just press START or touch the bottom-left corner of the Touch Screen, then choose the top-left icon in the Corner Menu!</string>
  <string id="22860">Then choose which slot you want to use, and save the game!</string>
  <string id="22861">It&apos;s up to you to remember to save your game as you go, Sonic, so keep that in mind!</string>
  <string id="22863">How do I save my game?</string>
  <string id="22867">Well, of course you could have. But now you don&apos;t have to!</string>
  <string id="22868">I totally could have jumped over those boxes, you know.</string>
  <string id="22871">This might be a good time to save your game, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="22872">Good idea, Tails.</string>
  <string id="22873">Oh, sure. I guess you know what you&apos;re doing!</string>
  <string id="22874">Please stop reminding me to save my game.</string>
  <string id="22876">Sonic, this would be a very good place to save your game!</string>
  <string id="22877">Of course. You know what you&apos;re doing!</string>
  <string id="22878">This would be another good time to save the game, if you haven&apos;t in a while!</string>
  <string id="22879">Sure thing!</string>
  <string id="22880">All right!</string>
  <string id="22881">Please stop reminding me to save my game.</string>
  <string id="22883">Right!</string>
  <string id="22884">Please stop reminding me to save.</string>
  <string id="22886">Oh, and this might be a good time to save your game, if you haven&apos;t saved in a while!</string>
  <string id="22887">Sure. You know what you&apos;re doing!</string>
  <string id="22888">Just head outside when you&apos;re ready to go. It won&apos;t take me long to rewire the communicators!</string>
  <string id="22889">Good idea.</string>
  <string id="22890">Please stop reminding me to save.</string>
  <string id="22892">This would also be a good time to... what&apos;s that you call it? Save your game, and what not?</string>
  <string id="22893">Of course it&apos;s a good idea! It&apos;s one of mine!</string>
  <string id="22894">Ha ha ha! Suit yourself! Still, no hurry to rush up to Angel Island, right?</string>
  <string id="22895">Why rush into battle when there might be things we can do from here?</string>
  <string id="22896">Simply come to me when you are ready to teleport to Angel Island. Only I have the proper coordinates for the jump!</string>
  <string id="22898">Good idea! Let&apos;s save!</string>
  <string id="22900">Hm. Maybe it&apos;s time to stop with the reminders to save the game.</string>
  <string id="22906">This would be a perfect time to save the game if you haven&apos;t saved in a while.</string>
  <string id="22907">Sonic, we might want to save here before we go... just in case.</string>
  <string id="22908">Thanks!</string>
  <string id="22909">Sure. </string>
  <string id="22910">This is a great time to save the game, by the way, now that we&apos;ve found more Chaos Emeralds!</string>
  <string id="22911">Of course. You know what you&apos;re doing!</string>
  <string id="22913">Good idea, Tails.</string>
  <string id="22915">I know when to save the game, Tails.</string>
  <string id="22917">Sure thing.</string>
  <string id="22918">Stop reminding me to save the game, Tails.</string>
  <string id="22920">This would be a great time to save your game if you haven&apos;t saved in a while.</string>
  <string id="22921">You got it!</string>
  <string id="22922">Stop telling me to save the game, Tails.</string>
  <string id="22929">Knuckles would never betray us! He probably got captured!</string>
  <string id="22930">I have a bad feeling about this, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="22935">Sonic, wait for a moment!</string>
  <string id="22936">I&apos;m detecting serious power fluctuations coming from this door. I think maybe this is Ix&apos;s chamber!</string>
  <string id="22937">Once we go through this door, that&apos;s it: the final confrontation with Ix!</string>
  <string id="22938">This would be a great time to save, Sonic. We&apos;ve come a long way, and... it&apos;s about to be all over, one way or the other.</string>
  <string id="22939">If there&apos;s anything else we need to do before... before we face Ix... we should do that first.</string>
  <string id="22940">Whenever you think you&apos;re ready, let&apos;s go through that door and face Ix!</string>
  <string id="22947">Sonic, we have power!</string>
  <string id="22948">But there&apos;s a problem. Eggman&apos;s Dimensional Buffer is in the Hazard Vault. </string>
  <string id="22949">Without that, the spaceship would never withstand the rigors of dimensional travel!</string>
  <string id="22950">Great! Once we have the Dimensional Buffer, we can take off after Ix!</string>
  <string id="22951">Eggman says he thinks most of the robots will have escaped already.</string>
  <string id="22952">It should be a matter of just going in and getting the part!</string>
  <string id="22953">I&apos;m sure you can handle anything else that&apos;s in there!</string>
  <string id="22954">We&apos;re not quite done getting the ship together. If you can get the last part, we can get all this done sooner.</string>
  <string id="22957">Then we&apos;re on our way!</string>
  <string id="22959">Anything we should be looking out for?</string>
  <string id="22961">Why do I doubt it&apos;ll be that easy?</string>
  <string id="22962">Why doesn&apos;t Eggman go get it himself?</string>
  <string id="22964">Wait. What did he say?</string>
  <string id="22965">Shade says the water should be draining out any moment now.</string>
  <string id="22968">That did it!</string>
  <string id="22969">No!</string>
  <string id="22970">All right, Charyb. Looks like you&apos;ve been beached.</string>
  <string id="22974">If we flip that switch, that&apos;ll drain the water out of Charyb&apos;s lair.</string>
  <string id="22975">And Sonic&apos;s team won&apos;t drown fighting Charyb. Got it. Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="22978">Sonic, I don&apos;t like the look of this. Maybe we should take a moment and save.</string>
  <string id="22979">Right!</string>
  <string id="22980">Let&apos;s go. And be on your guard.</string>
  <string id="22981">Maybe we should take a moment and save the game, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="22982">Thanks! Let&apos;s save the game real quick and get moving!</string>
  <string id="22983">Sure thing, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="22988">Sure thing.</string>
  <string id="22989">Stop reminding me to save, Tails.</string>
  <string id="22991">Good idea, Tails.</string>
  <string id="22992">Stop reminding me to save, Tails.</string>
  <string id="22999">We might want to save here, Sonic. This could be dangerous!</string>
  <string id="23000">Let&apos;s hurry!</string>
  <string id="23001">Maybe we should save here, before we go any further!</string>
  <string id="23002">Let&apos;s take a moment to save, and then keep moving!</string>
  <string id="23003">Of course. Then let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="23005">This would also be another time when it might be good to save the game!</string>
  <string id="23006">We should get moving soon, but there might be more here we haven&apos;t discovered!</string>
  <string id="23008">Good idea!</string>
  <string id="23009">I know when to save the game, Tails.</string>
  <string id="23012">Maybe we should save our game, Sonic. This looks like a good time!</string>
  <string id="23013">Sure thing, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="23014">Sounds like a good idea.</string>
  <string id="23015">Enough with the save reminders, Tails.</string>
  <string id="23019">Retry</string>
  <string id="23020">Reload</string>
  <string id="23022">I see something under the snow there. I&apos;ll try to move it, but it&apos;ll probably take a seismic force of unnatural proportions to move that much snow!</string>
  <string id="23023">Maybe if you come back later, you can help me figure out what&apos;s under there!</string>
  <string id="23027">You&apos;re back! I heard a loud explosion off to the east, and the snow crumbled and melted!</string>
  <string id="23028">You know anything about that?</string>
  <string id="23029">Crazy. Well, now that the snow&apos;s gone, maybe you can help me get this door open!</string>
  <string id="23030">The Marauders? Really? Yikes!</string>
  <string id="23031">Well, now that this snow&apos;s gone, maybe you can help me get this door open!</string>
  <string id="23032">Hey, I still can&apos;t move that snow. Check back later!</string>
  <string id="23035">Yeah, that was us.</string>
  <string id="23037">The Marauders caused a landslide.</string>
  <string id="23041">This would be a good time to take a moment and save the game, Sonic!</string>
  <string id="23042">Sure thing!</string>
  <string id="23043">Maybe if we went to Sector Scylla first and recovered the Chaos Emeralds there?</string>
  <string id="23044">Hm. The Chaos Emeralds might protect you from the shield... if you had enough of them. It&apos;s worth a try.</string>
  <string id="23045">When you&apos;re ready to go, just choose Sector Scylla from the travel map!</string>
  <string id="23046">I can&apos;t wait to see what these aliens are like!</string>
  <string id="23047">Good idea, Tails.</string>
  <string id="23048">I don&apos;t need you to remind me to save anymore.</string>
  <string id="23052">Then Sector Scylla it is. Let&apos;s get moving.</string>
  <string id="23064">Hey! The Chao Egg icon on the top screen is shaking! That means a Chao hatched in your Chao Garden!</string>
  <string id="23065">To access your Chao Garden, touch the Corner Menu.</string>
  <string id="23066">Touch the icon that looks like a Chao&apos;s face.</string>
  <string id="23070">Hm. This door seems to be jammed. Maybe there&apos;s another way out!</string>
  <string id="23076">Sure thing. I&apos;ll go below decks and make sure everything&apos;s working properly.</string>

  <string id="23718">We&apos;ll get the Marauders for what they did to you, my friend.</string>
  <string id="23719">Let&apos;s get to it. The Marauders must pay.</string>
  <string id="23727">Just our luck.</string>
  <string id="23728">Sonic! Is everything all right?</string>
  <string id="23729">You shot an opening in the fleet, but there was a cannon on Angel Island.</string>
  <string id="23730">Oh no!</string>
  <string id="23731">It&apos;s okay, Tails. We&apos;re all fine here.</string>
  <string id="23732">I hate to rain on your parade, Big Blue, but look over there.</string>
  <string id="23733">Uh... Am I the only one who sees all of those guys over there?</string>
  <string id="23734">I don&apos;t know, Sonic. Look!</string>
  <string id="23735">Yeah. We&apos;re just surrounded by Marauders. We&apos;ll be just fine.</string>
  <string id="23736">NEGATIVE. MARAUDER LIFE SIGNS DETECTED.</string>
  <string id="23737">Uhm, Sonic? I think there&apos;s a lot of Marauders out there....</string>
  <string id="23738">I&apos;m not so sure about that. Look!</string>
  <string id="23752">The commander sends his regards.</string>
  <string id="23754">Sonic and his friends found five Eggman Devices, and Tails noticed that the devices fit together to make a single machine: some kind of Pattern Generator. Tails isn&apos;t sure what the machine does exactly, but he thinks the device might cancel a forcefield or open an electronic lock.</string>
  <string id="23755">One more, and we can build this spaceship!</string>

  <string id="23773">Power and Damage</string>
  <string id="23774">Touch your target to select it.</string>
  <string id="23775">Some characters are stronger than others, and thus do more damage. This isn&apos;t shown in their stats, since it&apos;s a special part of each character.&#13;
&#13;
Characters who do more damage have a higher damage rating. Damage can be increased through status effects like Empowered and decreased through status effects like Weakened. You can also increase damage with certain items and equipment.&#13;
&#13;
See the Codex entries for each character to learn more about how strong each character can be!</string>
  <string id="23776">Number of Attacks</string>
  <string id="23777">Some characters naturally have more attacks per round of combat than other characters, simply because they&apos;re faster.&#13;
&#13;
See each character&apos;s Codex entry to find out more about how quick they are in combat!</string>
  <string id="23778">POW Moves use PP (POW Points) to execute. &#13;
&#13;
If you run out of PP you can defend or use POW items in order to regain them.</string>

  <string id="23791">Armor</string>
  <string id="23792">Some characters have higher armor than others. Since this is a natural ability for each character, the values are not listed.&#13;
&#13;
Higher armor means characters take less damage from enemy attacks. Many characters with low armor have a higher DEF to make up for that! Characters can have their armor increased by status effects like Fortified or decreased by effects like Vulnerable, and you can increase your armor with certain items and equipment.&#13;

  <string id="23827">I&apos;ve seen some suspicious activity on those high cliffs. Maybe if you got those vents blowing, you could fly up there.</string>
  <string id="23828">Good luck getting the vents working, though.</string>
  <string id="23829">I think I have some ideas about how it works. If you need my help, I&apos;ll give you hints for a price.</string>

  <string id="23931">Look, Sonic! The Chaos Emerald!</string>
  <string id="23935">We have to stop him!</string>
  <string id="23936">It looks like he&apos;s locked that door behind him. We have to find a way in!</string>
  <string id="23945">You&apos;re not done yet ... oh, wait, goodness, me!  You&apos;re done!  You&apos;ve found everything there is to find.&#13;
&#13;
Good job.</string>
  <string id="23946">Lucky!</string>
  <string id="23947">Item Theft</string>
  <string id="23948">Rouge&apos;s Plunder ability can steal items from enemies in combat! Each level of Item Theft will steal different items.&#13;
&#13;
Level 1 steals POW Candy or Health Seed.&#13;
Level 2 steals POW Gum or Health Leaf.&#13;
Level 3 steals POW Drink or Health Root.</string>
  <string id="23951">Full Auto</string>
  <string id="23952">Full Auto attacks  are actually lots of little attacks aimed at a target all at once. Each attack does only a fraction of the damage of most other attacks, but if enough of them hit the target, the damage can be very high!</string>
  <string id="23953">Blast</string>
  <string id="23954">Blast attacks target a single target. That target takes full damage, and foes standing next to the target take half damage!</string>
  <string id="23960">POW Moves and Status Effects</string>
  <string id="23961">Many POW Moves cause status effects, such as Weakened or Sluggish. You&apos;ll see in the Moves&apos; Effect descriptions what status effects they cause.&#13;
If you see a number after the status effect (like Sluggish 2), that means that the POW Move causes a level 2 Sluggish effect--more powerful than Sluggish 1!&#13;
If you see a percentage after the status effect, such as Weakened 1 (30%), that means the POW Move has a 30% chance of causing the level 1 Weakened effect.</string>
  <string id="23962">The search for Knuckles is on!&#13;
&#13;
Using a device built by Tails to detect the source of the Marauders&apos; signal, the team discovered a secret base deep within Mystic Ruins. Confident that this would be the place where the Marauders were keeping Knuckles, the team prepared themselves to delve into the Marauders&apos; hidden headquarters!</string>

  <string id="23972">The General is tough, but fair.</string>
  <string id="23973">They&apos;re watching. </string>
  <string id="23974">When will this day be over?</string>
  <string id="23986">We need to find Omega. I don&apos;t want to leave him out there in Metropolis alone.</string>
  <string id="23987">Thank you.</string>
  <string id="23989">We should go find Omega before we go.</string>
  <string id="23999">This door seems to be locked. There has to be a way through!</string>
  <string id="24071">Wait, Sonic! We have to find a way to help Knuckles defeat the Gizoid Centurions!</string>
  <string id="24079">Shade says... robotics labs near you... should be something in there....</string>
  <string id="24081">Shade says there should be something nearby. Let&apos;s keep looking!</string>
  <string id="24083">Watch your HP in combat, and use Health items to heal your team!</string>
  <string id="24084">Counter enemy POW Moves by tapping all the buttons that appear.</string>
  <string id="24085">Use Defend to take less damage and regain some PP.</string>
  <string id="24086">POW Moves never miss if you correctly do all of the inputs that appear, unless the opponent is Phased or Evading.</string>
  <string id="24087">Characters spend PP to do POW Moves.</string>

  <string id="24092">Combine POW Moves, Chao, items and elemental effects for maximum damage.</string>
  <string id="24093">Try to put multiple effects on a difficult enemy so that your basic attacks are more effective.</string>

  <string id="24184">Oh, sure. I guess you know what you&apos;re doing!</string>
  <string id="24189">Good idea, Tails.</string>
  <string id="24190">Please stop reminding me to save my game.</string>
  <string id="24192">Maybe this would be a good time to save the game, Sonic.</string>

  <string id="24194">Good idea, Tails.</string>
  <string id="24195">Please stop reminding me to save my game.</string>
  <string id="24197">There&apos;s nothing here we can use, Sonic. It&apos;s all knickknacks and useless junk.</string>
  <string id="24198">Hmph. One man&apos;s junk is another man&apos;s priceless artifact, I always say.</string>
  <string id="24202">Present day,</string>
  <string id="24203">... the other side of the world.</string>
  <string id="24208">You just got an item! You can use items in combat and also from your inventory screen.</string>
  <string id="24209">&#13;
Your first option is to attack.&#13;
Attack will use up all of your actions against a single target.</string>
  <string id="24210">Maybe we should save the game, Sonic. This place could be rough.</string>

  <string id="24218">I think we should save the game now, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="24219">Oh, sure. I guess you know what you&apos;re doing!</string>
  <string id="24220">We&apos;ll be careful. Thanks!</string>
  <string id="24221">Good idea, Tails.</string>
  <string id="24222">Please stop reminding me to save my game.</string>
  <string id="24225">Let&apos;s save the game and go find that cannon!</string>
  <string id="24226">We might want to save the game here, Sonic, if we haven&apos;t in a while.</string>
  <string id="24227">Right.</string>
  <string id="24230">This would be a very good time to save the game, Sonic.</string>
  <string id="24231">Oh, sure. I guess you know what you&apos;re doing!</string>
  <string id="24232">We should probably save the game, Sonic. I bet someone&apos;ll be guarding the Emerald!</string>
  <string id="24233">Let&apos;s go!</string>
